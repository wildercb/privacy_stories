You may receive a confirmation text/pickup ready SMS text message. 9. We may use your data to market to you or people similar to you on our internal system. Your information is never revealed to the person being marketed to, to the public, or to third parties. For example, our system may determine that because of your spending habits, people like you may want to buy the same thing \u2013 we\u2019d then recommend that person buys something because of the way you spent. We do not share your information with them. We may also market back to you based on your own spending habits. 10. We may use your data in the aggregate to make actionable insights in real time to other restaurants and their employees. For example, our system may use your spending habits to attempt to predict popular times and rush times, sharing this information with restaurant employees to prepare appropriately for when they might get busy. 11.We may use data about you to link actions across the platform and attribute them to you, for example if you use the same card or the same email address on two different platform actions, we\u2019ll link them to your customer profile 12.

By storing cookies, we are able to securely, magically log you back in without you having to type in your username and password each and every time. By disabling cookies, you will not be able to persist your login, although the rest of the service should function fine. If you clear your cookies, you\u2019ll lose any saved login details you may have had. We store information on your device specifically related to your visit and your site data. Most commonly, we\u2019ll save your carts and abandoned carts so that just in case something happens, you don\u2019t lose your order progress. If you disable local and session storage on your machine, the service will function fine, but your carts will be cleared on each visit, or if something out of the ordinary happens, such as a page crash, you\u2019ll lose your progress. Cards and PCI As a facilitator of card transactions, we take card privacy, PCI compliance, and general security very seriously. Although our legal agreements with our processing partners (and general security concerns) prevent us from going fully into detail about what measures we take, we can say this: Card data is sent directly to our payment partners, and is never stored on our servers. Saved cards are stored managed by these partners. We follow and abide by ALL PCI regulations and standards. We accept the 4 major American Card brands: Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. We apply a 5.99% Convenience Fee to offset the restaurants cost of cards and help pay for the service. This fee is applied in compliance with convenience fee programs set by the card brands. Fulfillment Policy Orders that are recieved are prepared for the designated time provided. Please come to the pickup window and state your name. The associate may ask you to provide additional information for verification purposes. If your order is recieved but not ready, the restaurant will do their best in good faith to notify you when it will be ready. Enjoy! Occasionally, for reasons that are beyond our control, orders that are confirmed are not received. Power outages, network interruptions, severe weather, etc, may impact a restaurants ability to receive online orders.\nUser: Write the privacy behaviors found within this text and those which are connected reflect a critical understanding of the text.

Our top priority is to ensure that your original intent (purchasing food items through our software) is fulfilled. If an order confirmation is given, that is our system telling us it did its job. In the case of an order being confirmed, our system has processed your order. In the case of an order confirmation going through, but the restaurant not receiving it, we typically look first at external sources such as power outages or network interruptions, such as internet service providers having a service outage. Our system does our best to ensure a reliable connection is made before confirming the order, but this isn\u2019t (and can\u2019t) always be the case. Some orders, as is with technology, may slip through the cracks and miss all filters and precautions put in place. We will reconcile with you and with the restaurant in this case to ensure everyone is satisfied. Delivery and Shipment Policy Blueplate does not offer delivery services \u2013 any order placed for delivery on the Blueplate network is fufilled by the restaurants own delivery drivers. Any and all delivery policies are to be deferred to that restaurant. Issues with and concerning delivery are typically deferred to the restaurant. Blueplate will attempt to fix any delivery errors in good faith, but as Blueplate does not offer delivery, we do not protect against any errors in this regard. In most cases, Blueplate is a pickup only service. Refund Policy In order to get a refund, please use the support and feedback center and get in contact diretly through those channels. We will provide a partial or full refund for a missing item, wrong item, or item that does not fall under normal standards, such as presence of hair. To cancel an order, please reach out as soon as possible. As ALL orders are made as soon as they are recieved, we may not be able to cancel all orders, but we will do our best in good faith to make things right.

Be mindful of avoiding assumptions or hallucinations that are not supported by the text.\nSystem: Privacy Behaviors:\nGiven the directive to ensure accuracy and alignment with the provided narrative \u2014 and acknowledging that the narrative primarily focuses on service operations rather than explicit engagements with personal data from a privacy policy perspective \u2014 the revised approach will be to closely adhere to the described functions and their potential implications for privacy behaviors. As outlined, privacy-specific behaviors were not directly delineated in the provided text, but I will attempt to create hypothetical privacy stories that, while speculative, are informed by the context of service provision.\n\n**Privacy stories:**\n\n1. **We (process) (Order Information) for the purpose of (Functionality: Provide Service).**\n   This suggests handling specifics of the food order to ensure it is prepared and relayed to the restaurant correctly, manifesting in service provision and order fulfillment functionalities.\n\n2. **We (process) (Contact Data) for the purpose of (Functionality: Provide Support).**\n   Implied in the actions of receiving complaints, feedback, or requests for refunds, there would reasonably be an interaction with user's contact information to address and resolve the presented issue efficiently, framed within the support aspect of service functionality.\n\n3. **We (process) (Order Information and Contact Data) for the purpose of (Requirement: Compliance).**\n   In handling cancellations and refunds, which requires a reactive interaction with the order details and user contact information, this behavior implicitly supports compliance with customer service expectations or, potentially, legal requirements around consumer rights and protections.\n\n4. **We (process) (Feedback) for the purpose of (Functionality: Service Improvement).**\n   This is inferred from intent to resolve any service errors or deficiencies (e.g., missing item, wrong item), indicating that customer feedback is utilized not just for immediate resolution but possibly for long-term service enhancements.\n\nPlease note, the specified privacy stories are interpretive to the degree that they propose privacy-related considerations rooted in hypothetical processing of user information for service delivery and support, assuming inherent data interactions necessary for operational success. These interpretations have been carefully crafted to align with the narrative provided and reflect a cautious approach to inferring privacy behaviors in the absence of explicit details on personal data handling practices.\nUser: Review the privacy behaviors identified .
