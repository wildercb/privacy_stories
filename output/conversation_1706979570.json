Your data may be used in the aggregate to make informed decisions regarding overall consumer spending habits or site visit habits. 8. You may receive a confirmation text/pickup ready SMS text message. 9. We may use your data to market to you or people similar to you on our internal system. Your information is never revealed to the person being marketed to, to the public, or to third parties. For example, our system may determine that because of your spending habits, people like you may want to buy the same thing \u2013 we\u2019d then recommend that person buys something because of the way you spent. We do not share your information with them. We may also market back to you based on your own spending habits. 10. We may use your data in the aggregate to make actionable insights in real time to other restaurants and their employees. For example, our system may use your spending habits to attempt to predict popular times and rush times, sharing this information with restaurant employees to prepare appropriately for when they might get busy. 11.We may use data about you to link actions across the platform and attribute them to you, for example if you use the same card or the same email address on two different platform actions, we\u2019ll link them to your customer profile 12. We may collect data about your visit and site habits, such as what you click on, how you interact with the site, how long you visit for, and more. We may collect your IP address and other information regarding your internet connection, mostly for security purposes. Cookies and Device Storage We collect cookies, but not the kind you eat, as well as store information on your device. Everything Blueplate does related to cookies and device storage are for your convenience only, and shouldn\u2019t affect your use of the service as a whole. We use cookies exclusively for authentication purposes. By storing cookies, we are able to securely, magically log you back in without you having to type in your username and password each and every time. By disabling cookies, you will not be able to persist your login, although the rest of the service should function fine. If you clear your cookies, you\u2019ll lose any saved login details you may have had. We store information on your device specifically related to your visit and your site data. Most commonly, we\u2019ll save your carts and abandoned carts so that just in case something happens, you don\u2019t lose your order progress. If you disable local and session storage on your machine, the service will function fine, but your carts will be cleared on each visit, or if something out of the ordinary happens, such as a page crash, you\u2019ll lose your progress. Cards and PCI As a facilitator of card transactions, we take card privacy, PCI compliance, and general security very seriously. Although our legal agreements with our processing partners (and general security concerns) prevent us from going fully into detail about what measures we take, we can say this: Card data is sent directly to our payment partners, and is never stored on our servers. Saved cards are stored managed by these partners. We follow and abide by ALL PCI regulations and standards. We accept the 4 major American Card brands: Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. We apply a 5.99% Convenience Fee to offset the restaurants cost of cards and help pay for the service. This fee is applied in compliance with convenience fee programs set by the card brands. Fulfillment Policy Orders that are recieved are prepared for the designated time provided. Please come to the pickup window and state your name. The associate may ask you to provide additional information for verification purposes. If your order is recieved but not ready, the restaurant will do their best in good faith to notify you when it will be ready. Enjoy! Occasionally, for reasons that are beyond our control, orders that are confirmed are not received. Power outages, network interruptions, severe weather, etc, may impact a restaurants ability to receive online orders. In this case, we\u2019ll reconcile between all 3 parties (you, the restaurant, and Blueplate, the provider) will find the best solution to satisfy you. Our top priority is to ensure that your original intent (purchasing food items through our software) is fulfilled. If an order confirmation is given, that is our system telling us it did its job. In the case of an order being confirmed, our system has processed your order. In the case of an order confirmation going through, but the restaurant not receiving it, we typically look first at external sources such as power outages or network interruptions, such as internet service providers having a service outage. Our system does our best to ensure a reliable connection is made before confirming the order, but this isn\u2019t (and can\u2019t) always be the case. Some orders, as is with technology, may slip through the cracks and miss all filters and precautions put in place. We will reconcile with you and with the restaurant in this case to ensure everyone is satisfied. Delivery and Shipment Policy Blueplate does not offer delivery services \u2013 any order placed for delivery on the Blueplate network is fufilled by the restaurants own delivery drivers. Any and all delivery policies are to be deferred to that restaurant. Issues with and concerning delivery are typically deferred to the restaurant. Blueplate will attempt to fix any delivery errors in good faith, but as Blueplate does not offer delivery, we do not protect against any errors in this regard. In most cases, Blueplate is a pickup only service. Refund Policy In order to get a refund, please use the support and feedback center and get in contact diretly through those channels. We will provide a partial or full refund for a missing item, wrong item, or item that does not fall under normal standards, such as presence of hair. To cancel an order, please reach out as soon as possible. As ALL orders are made as soon as they are recieved, we may not be able to cancel all orders, but we will do our best in good faith to make things right.

You may receive general marketing communications from Blueplate, with an option to \u201copt out\u201d or \u201cunsubscribe\u201d 7. Your data may be used in the aggregate to make informed decisions regarding overall consumer spending habits or site visit habits. 8. You may receive a confirmation text/pickup ready SMS text message. 9. We may use your data to market to you or people similar to you on our internal system. Your information is never revealed to the person being marketed to, to the public, or to third parties. For example, our system may determine that because of your spending habits, people like you may want to buy the same thing \u2013 we\u2019d then recommend that person buys something because of the way you spent. We do not share your information with them. We may also market back to you based on your own spending habits. 10. We may use your data in the aggregate to make actionable insights in real time to other restaurants and their employees. For example, our system may use your spending habits to attempt to predict popular times and rush times, sharing this information with restaurant employees to prepare appropriately for when they might get busy. 11.We may use data about you to link actions across the platform and attribute them to you, for example if you use the same card or the same email address on two different platform actions, we\u2019ll link them to your customer profile 12. We may collect data about your visit and site habits, such as what you click on, how you interact with the site, how long you visit for, and more. We may collect your IP address and other information regarding your internet connection, mostly for security purposes. Cookies and Device Storage We collect cookies, but not the kind you eat, as well as store information on your device. Everything Blueplate does related to cookies and device storage are for your convenience only, and shouldn\u2019t affect your use of the service as a whole. We use cookies exclusively for authentication purposes. By storing cookies, we are able to securely, magically log you back in without you having to type in your username and password each and every time. By disabling cookies, you will not be able to persist your login, although the rest of the service should function fine. If you clear your cookies, you\u2019ll lose any saved login details you may have had. We store information on your device specifically related to your visit and your site data. Most commonly, we\u2019ll save your carts and abandoned carts so that just in case something happens, you don\u2019t lose your order progress. If you disable local and session storage on your machine, the service will function fine, but your carts will be cleared on each visit, or if something out of the ordinary happens, such as a page crash, you\u2019ll lose your progress. Cards and PCI As a facilitator of card transactions, we take card privacy, PCI compliance, and general security very seriously. Although our legal agreements with our processing partners (and general security concerns) prevent us from going fully into detail about what measures we take, we can say this: Card data is sent directly to our payment partners, and is never stored on our servers. Saved cards are stored managed by these partners. We follow and abide by ALL PCI regulations and standards. We accept the 4 major American Card brands: Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. We apply a 5.99% Convenience Fee to offset the restaurants cost of cards and help pay for the service. This fee is applied in compliance with convenience fee programs set by the card brands. Fulfillment Policy Orders that are recieved are prepared for the designated time provided. Please come to the pickup window and state your name. The associate may ask you to provide additional information for verification purposes. If your order is recieved but not ready, the restaurant will do their best in good faith to notify you when it will be ready. Enjoy! Occasionally, for reasons that are beyond our control, orders that are confirmed are not received. Power outages, network interruptions, severe weather, etc, may impact a restaurants ability to receive online orders. In this case, we\u2019ll reconcile between all 3 parties (you, the restaurant, and Blueplate, the provider) will find the best solution to satisfy you. Our top priority is to ensure that your original intent (purchasing food items through our software) is fulfilled. If an order confirmation is given, that is our system telling us it did its job. In the case of an order being confirmed, our system has processed your order. In the case of an order confirmation going through, but the restaurant not receiving it, we typically look first at external sources such as power outages or network interruptions, such as internet service providers having a service outage. Our system does our best to ensure a reliable connection is made before confirming the order, but this isn\u2019t (and can\u2019t) always be the case. Some orders, as is with technology, may slip through the cracks and miss all filters and precautions put in place. We will reconcile with you and with the restaurant in this case to ensure everyone is satisfied. Delivery and Shipment Policy Blueplate does not offer delivery services \u2013 any order placed for delivery on the Blueplate network is fufilled by the restaurants own delivery drivers. Any and all delivery policies are to be deferred to that restaurant. Issues with and concerning delivery are typically deferred to the restaurant. Blueplate will attempt to fix any delivery errors in good faith, but as Blueplate does not offer delivery, we do not protect against any errors in this regard. In most cases, Blueplate is a pickup only service. Refund Policy In order to get a refund, please use the support and feedback center and get in contact diretly through those channels. We will provide a partial or full refund for a missing item, wrong item, or item that does not fall under normal standards, such as presence of hair. To cancel an order, please reach out as soon as possible. As ALL orders are made as soon as they are recieved, we may not be able to cancel all orders, but we will do our best in good faith to make things right.
