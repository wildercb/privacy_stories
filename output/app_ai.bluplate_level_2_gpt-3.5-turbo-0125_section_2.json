In the case of an order being confirmed, our system has processed your order. In the case of an order confirmation going through, but the restaurant not receiving it, we typically look first at external sources such as power outages or network interruptions, such as internet service providers having a service outage. Our system does our best to ensure a reliable connection is made before confirming the order, but this isn\u2019t (and can\u2019t) always be the case. Some orders, as is with technology, may slip through the cracks and miss all filters and precautions put in place. We will reconcile with you and with the restaurant in this case to ensure everyone is satisfied. Delivery and Shipment Policy Blueplate does not offer delivery services \u2013 any order placed for delivery on the Blueplate network is fufilled by the restaurants own delivery drivers. Any and all delivery policies are to be deferred to that restaurant. Issues with and concerning delivery are typically deferred to the restaurant. Blueplate will attempt to fix any delivery errors in good faith, but as Blueplate does not offer delivery, we do not protect against any errors in this regard. In most cases, Blueplate is a pickup only service. Refund Policy In order to get a refund, please use the support and feedback center and get in contact diretly through those channels. We will provide a partial or full refund for a missing item, wrong item, or item that does not fall under normal standards, such as presence of hair.
