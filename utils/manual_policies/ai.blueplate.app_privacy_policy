Cards and PCI As a facilitator of card transactions, we take card privacy, PCI compliance, and general security very seriously.

Saved cards are [#a(share) stored managed by these partners].]  /}[#NS We follow and abide by ALL PCI regulations and standards. We accept the 4 major American Card brands: Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. We apply a 5.99% Convenience Fee to offset the restaurants cost of cards and help pay for the service. This fee is applied in compliance with convenience fee programs set by the card brands. Fulfillment Policy Orders that are recieved are prepared for the designated time provided. Please come to the pickup window and state your name. The associate may ask you to provide additional information for verification purposes. If your order is recieved but not ready, the restaurant will do their best in good faith to notify you when it will be ready. Enjoy! Occasionally, for reasons that are beyond our control, orders that are confirmed are not received. Power outages, network interruptions, severe weather, etc, may impact a restaurants ability to receive online orders. In this case, we’ll reconcile between all 3 parties (you, the restaurant, and Blueplate, the provider) will find the best solution to satisfy you. Our top priority is to ensure that your original intent (purchasing food items through our software) is fulfilled. If an order confirmation is given, that is our system telling us it did its job. In the case of an order being confirmed, our system has processed your order. In the case of an order confirmation going through, but the restaurant not receiving it, we typically look first at external sources such as power outages or network interruptions, such as internet service providers having a service outage. Our system does our best to ensure a reliable connection is made before confirming the order, but this isn’t (and can’t) always be the case. Some orders, as is with technology, may slip through the cracks and miss all filters and precautions put in place. We will reconcile with you and with the restaurant in this case to ensure everyone is satisfied. Delivery and Shipment Policy Blueplate does not offer delivery services – any order placed for delivery on the Blueplate network is fufilled by the restaurants own delivery drivers. Any and all delivery policies are to be deferred to that restaurant. Issues with and concerning delivery are typically deferred to the restaurant. Blueplate will attempt to fix any delivery errors in good faith, but as Blueplate does not offer delivery, we do not protect against any errors in this regard. In most cases, Blueplate is a pickup only service. Refund Policy In order to get a refund, please use the support and feedback center and get in contact diretly through those channels. We will provide a partial or full refund for a missing item, wrong item, or item that does not fall under normal standards, such as presence of hair. To cancel an order, please reach out as soon as possible. As ALL orders are made as soon as they are recieved, we may not be able to cancel all orders, but we will do our best in good faith to make things right.
