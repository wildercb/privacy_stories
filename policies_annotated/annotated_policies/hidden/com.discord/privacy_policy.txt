Welcome! This Privacy Policy explains how we [#a collect], [#a  use], [#a store], protect, and [#a share] your [#dt personal information] through our services. [#ns If you reside in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or United Kingdom, Discord Netherlands BV is the “data controller” of your personal information collected through the services (as defined in our
Terms of Service ). For everyone else, Discord Inc. is the data controller. It’s important that you read this entire policy, but here’s a summary to get you started: We care a lot about privacy . We are committed to creating spaces where people can come together and find a place to belong. Respecting user privacy is a key part of that mission. We don’t sell your personal information . Our business is based on subscriptions and paid products, not from selling your personal information to third parties. We limit what information is required ].{#s  We [#a(collect) require] the information that enables us to create your account, [#p(functionality) provide and maintain our services], meet our commitments to our users, and satisfy our [#p legal requirements]. /} [#ns The rest is optional. We care deeply about safety . Our dedicated Trust & Safety team works hard to help keep our community safe.]  {#s We also [#a use] certain information to help us [#p(security) identify violations of our Community Guidelines] and [#p (security:user security) prevent harmful content from being distributed through the services]. /} [#ns We give you control . We give you the ability to control your privacy on Discord. ‍ ‍ Discord is your place to find community We created Discord to be a platform that brings people together over shared experiences and gives everyone a place to belong. Whether you’re part of a club, gaming group, or just a handful of friends that want to spend time together, Discord makes it easy to express yourself and find community. Our “services” has the same meaning as defined in the
Terms of Service . They include the Discord app, which can be accessed on mobile, web, desktop, console, or even a connected home appliance—any device with a web browser and internet connection. We also have a website, blog, and support center, and] {#s we may [#a collect] your information through other means like [#dt surveys], [#dt emails], and [#dt social media]. /}[#ns If we build another product, our services include that too. As explained in our
Terms of Service , we allow users to add content to the services in a number of different ways, including via direct messages and in smaller and larger spaces. If you share content within larger spaces, that content may be accessed by many people, including people you do not know. For example, some servers are available in the Server Discovery section of the app and do not require an invite link to join. Other server owners may publish their server invite link on public websites. Anyone can access these servers, and you should be aware that server owners or admins set these permissions, and like the size of a server, the permissions may change over time. We may also use content posted in larger spaces, to help us improve and power features like
Highlights Notifications , identify harmful content on the services, and enforce our
Terms of Service
and
Community Guidelines . These things are important to us, and we believe they will make Discord even better for our users. We will always try to let you know the type of space you are in (although we don’t control where invite links are shared or the permissions for that server). You can limit the extent to which your content is used for these purposes as described in the “How to control your privacy” section below. You should take all of this into account when you are using our services, and choose the spaces, features, and settings that are most appropriate for your content. We make money from paid subscriptions and the sale of digital (and sometimes physical) goods, not from selling your personal information to third parties.] ‍ {#s The information we [#a collect] We [#a collect] certain information when you use Discord. This includes information you [#a(collect) provide to us], information we [#a collect automatically], and information we [#a (collect:external) receive from other sources]. Information you provide to us [#dt Account information] . When you create a Discord account, you can come up with a [#dt username] and [#dt password], and provide a way of [#p contacting] you (such as an [#dt email address] and/or [#dt phone number]). You’ll also need to provide your [#dt birthday.] /} In some cases, you may be required to verify your account or provide additional information (like a verified phone number) to your account. [#dt You may also have the option to add your name or nicknames. Content you create . This includes any content that you upload to the service. For example, you may write messages or posts (including drafts), send voice messages, create custom emojis, create short recordings of GoLive activity, or upload and share files through the services. This also includes your profile information and the information you provide when you create servers. We generally do not store the contents of video or voice calls or channels. If we were to change that in the future (for example, to facilitate content moderation), we would disclose that to you in advance. We also don’t store streaming content when you share your screen, but we do retain the thumbnail cover image for the stream for a short period of time. We may build features that help users engage with voice and video content, like create or send short recordings. Payment information ]. {#s  If you [#p(app functionality: payment) buy any paid services] through Discord, you may need to submit a valid [#dt(payment card) payment method and associated billing information], including [#dt your full name] and [#dt billing address]. [#a(share) Our payment processors, like Stripe and PayPal, receive and process your payment information]. Depending on the processor, we may also receive and [#a store] certain [#dt billing information], including the [#dt last four digits of the credit card number] associated with the transaction. /} {#s  If you [#p(app functionality: payment) sell something] through Discord, you may be [#a(share) required to provide additional information to our payment processors], such as [#dt bank account information] to facilitate payments and copies of [#dt government issued identification] /}required to identify users in accordance with regulatory obligations. If we decide to process our own payments in the future, we would receive and process this information ourselves. Information from actions you take . {#s We [#a collect] information about your use of Discord and your activities on the services. This includes the [#dt friends you add], the [#dt(engagement) users, bots, and apps you engage with], the [#dt(app information) games you play on your device], the [#dt (engagement) servers or other communities you join] and participate in, your roles in servers,  [#dt (app interactions) content moderation decisions] you make, information about [#dt(spending habits) purchases or sales you make] /} on or through Discord including what you purchased or sold, and other related actions. You can control whether we collect, use, and display this information as described in the “How to control your privacy” section below. Information used to enable optional features . {#s Certain features, like [#p(app functionality) contact syncing], may require that you provide additional information (or grant us access to such information) to make them work. This also includes [#a(use third party) third-party integrations you choose to enable] and the data you [#a(external) authorize those third-party services to share with us.] For example, when you link a music streaming account, we may [#a collect] information about that account such as the [#dt(app interactions) song you are listening to] in order to [#p(app functionality) display that information on your profile] or as your status /} [#ns (if you have chosen to do so). Other information you provide directly to us . You may have the option to submit additional information as you use Discord. For example, you may choose to participate in our verified server program, which requires that you provide additional information about yourself or your company. Or, you may participate in surveys where you can provide feedback on the services, or submit information to our Discord Support teams.] {#s Information we [#a collect automatically] We also [#a collect] information automatically from you when you use Discord. This includes: Information about your device . We [#a collect] information about the device you are using to access the services. For example, this includes information like your [#dt IP address], [#dt operating system information], [#dt browser information], and information about your [#dt device settings], such as your microphone and/or camera.  [#dt(app interactions) Information about your use of the apps] or websites . For example, we collect log and event information related to how and when you use our services (such as the [#dt(engagement) pages, servers, and channels you visit, the activities you engage in, or the embedded content you interact with]). Other information that we [#a collect automatically] . When you take certain actions on other sites, we may [#a (collect: external) receive information about you]. For example, when we advertise for Discord on third party platforms, if you click on the ad, we may receive information about [#dt (interaction with ad) which ad you saw and on which platform]. Similarly, we may also receive certain information when you click on a referral link, such as which website you came from./} {#s We may [#dt(collect) receive information] from [#dt cookies] (small text files placed on your computer or device) and similar technologies. First-party cookies are placed by us (and our third-party service providers) and allow you to [#p (app functionality) use the services] and to help us [#p(analytics) analyze and improve your experience] and the services./} You can control cookies as described in the “How to control your privacy” section below. The services use the following types of cookies: {#s [#dt Strictly Necessary Cookies] : These are required for services to function and to meet our legal obligations. If you try to use tools to disable these cookies, parts of the services may not work properly. [#dt Functional Cookies] : These help us provide enhanced functionality on the services like remembering language preferences. Disabling these could affect some service functionality. [#dt Performance Cookies] : These allow us or our third-party analytics providers to [#p(user habits) learn how you and others use and engage with the services] /} so we can understand and improve them. Information we receive from other sources {#s We may [#a(collect:external) receive information] about you from other sources, including from other users and third parties, and combine that information with the other information we have about you. For example, if you interact with our social media account on another platform, we may receive certain information about you like [#dt(social media account details) your username on that platform]. ‍ How we use your information We use your information for the following purposes: ‍ To fulfill our contract with you To [#p(app functionality) provide you with the services] . /} We use your information to provide you with the Discord services. For example, {#s when you [#p(app functionality) start a video call], we [#a process] your [#dt images] and [#dt audio] to make that work. We similarly [#a collect and store] the messages you send and [#p(customization:memorization) display them as you direct.]  /} We also [#a use] the [#dt(personal data) information you provide] to us to [#p(accounts) create and manage your account] and to [#p(order fulfillment) facilitate purchases.] /} [#ns When you enable optional features (like connecting your Discord account to other platforms), we use information from those services to power the feature (like displaying what song you are listening to on another service within the Discord app). To meet our commitments to the Discord community . We work hard to try to make Discord a safe, positive, and inclusive place.] To do so, {#s we [#a use] [#dt(personal data) your information] to [#p(security) monitor for and take action against users and content that violate our Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and other policies.] This includes responding to user reports, generating transcriptions of content as part of our investigation, [#p(security) detecting fraud and malware], and [#a (collect) proactively scanning] [#dt(account information:files) attachments] and other content for illegal or harmful content. /} {#s  We also [#a use] certain information, which may include content reported to us, content that violates the Terms, and certain other content widely available on the service (such as [#dt (app interactions) public posts], [#dt (account information) usernames, avatars, banners, user profiles], [#dt(app interactions:engagement) server names, server icons, and server banners]), to [#p(data analysis)+(security) create systems and models that can be automated to more swiftly detect, categorize, and take action against prohibited content] or conduct. /} {#s To [#p contact you] . We [#a use] your information to [#p contact you] in connection with your account, such as to [#p(user protection) verify or secure it with two-factor authentication]. We may also [#a use] your information to [#p contact you] /} about important product or policy changes and to send you information about products you have purchased. To provide customer service . {#s We [#a use] [#dt(personal data) your information] to [#p(support) respond to your questions] about our products and services, and to [#dt(site protection) investigate bugs or other issues.] For our legitimate business interests [#p(app ) To protect our services] /}. {#s We [#a use] information to [#p(security) keep our services secure], to [#p(security) prevent misuse], and to [#p(security) enforce our Terms of Service and other policies] against users who violate them /}. To report on our company’s performance .{#s We [#a use] [#dt(personal data) your information] to [#p(analytics:data analysis) track the fundamental metrics of our business], [#p(analytics:data analysis) to perform financial reporting], [#p(requirements) to respond to regulatory obligations], and to debug billing issues. To [#p(customization) personalize the product] . /} {#s  We [#a use] your information to [#p(customization) personalize our services]. This information powers our discovery surfaces (so that you see relevant communities or content first), Highlights Notifications, and similar features, and it helps us surface [#p(personalized:advertisement) Discord features and promotions from us and our partners that may be of interest to you].  /}[#ns As discussed in the “How to control your privacy” section below, you can choose to what extent {#s we will [#a use] your [#dt personal information] to [#p(customization) personalize your Discord experience.] /} {#s [#p(app functionality) To improve our services] . We [#a use] [#dt(personal data) your information] to help us understand [#p(user habits:analytics) how users interact with our services], [#p(advertisement:personalized) what features or products users may want], or to otherwise understand and improve our services. This includes information about [#dt(app interactions:engagement) how you use our services and how servers are structured]. We may also [#a use] certain content that is widely available to better understand, for example, what [#dt(engagement) topics servers cover and what content is most interesting within those servers]. /} [#ns Similarly, you can limit to what extent we use your personal information for these purposes. To advertise our services on Discord and other platforms . We are proud of the product we've built. We may tell you about our paid services and other features directly in the services and through our own channels, and we spend money advertising Discord on other platforms.] {#s As part of that, we [#a use] certain information to assist in the [#p(advertisement:personalized) delivery of our advertising], to [#p(advertisement:effectiveness) measure the effectiveness of advertisements] for our own products, and to improve such advertisements in the future. To [#a contact] you . We may [#a use] [#dt(personal data) your information] to [#p(advertisement:personalized) let you know about new products or features we think you’ll like]. /} [#ns You may opt-out of receiving such marketing communications. Where local law requires, we will obtain your consent before sending such communications.] To comply with our legal obligations {#a We [#a retain] and [#a use] your information in connection with potential legal claims when necessary and for [#p(requirements:law compliance) compliance, regulatory, and auditing purposes]. For example, we [#a retain] information where we are [#p(requirements:law compliance) required by law] or if we are [#p(requirements:law compliance) compelled to do so by a court order or regulatory body]. Also, when you exercise any of your applicable legal rights to [#p(app functionality) access, amend, or delete your personal information], we may request additional information from you for the purpose of [#p(identification) confirming your identity].  /}‍ With your consent {#s ‍We may also [#a collect] and [#a use] personal information with your consent, such as to send you [#p(advertisement) marketing communications] /}where legally required. [#ns You can revoke your consent at any time (mostly through our services directly), though note that you might not be able to use any service or feature that requires collection or use of that personal information. ]‍{#s  [#p(security:user protection)To protect someone’s vital interests] We may [#a collect] or [#a share] [#dt personal data] /} if we think someone’s life is in danger—for example, to help resolve an urgent medical situation. ‍ How we disclose your information When you tell us to . When you add your content to the services, you are telling us to make that content available to certain people or communities. Who can access that information is determined by who can access a particular space. For servers, those permissions are set by server owners or admins. They control whether a server requires an invite link or is open and accessible to anyone. And these permissions, like the size of the server, may change over time. Similarly, if you link your Discord account with a third-party service (like a music-streaming service or gaming platform), embed content, or participate in a server that has third-party features like bots enabled, {#s we may [#a(share) provide certain information to that service or to other Discord users] to [#p(app functionality) operate that service or feature]. Additionally, if you [#p(payment) purchase goods or services from other users] on Discord, we may [#a(share) disclose] certain information to these users in order to facilitate the [#p(payment) delivery of the goods or services purchased] or [#p(analytics) help them understand and improve their business]. We may also disclose your information as you otherwise instruct us or provide us your consent to do so. With our vendors . We may [#a(use third party) provide information to vendors] we hire to carry out specific work for us. This includes payment processors like Stripe and PayPal that [#p(payment) process transactions] on our behalf and cloud providers like Google that [#p(data storage) host our data and our services]. We may also [#a(share) provide] limited information to advertising platforms to help us [#p(advertisement) reach people that we think will like our products] and to [#p(marketing effectiveness) measure the performance of our ads] /}shown on those platforms. [#ns We do this to help bring more users to Discord and make our business successful, and provide only the information required to facilitate these services.] This may include information like the fact that you installed our app or registered to use Discord. To comply with the law .{#s  We may [#a disclose] information in response to a request for information if we believe [#a disclosure] is [#p(legal compliance) required by law], /} including meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. [#ns Where allowed and feasible, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice before disclosing your information in response to such a request. Our Transparency Report has additional information about how we respond to requests from governments and law enforcement entities. In an emergency ]. {#s We may [#a disclose] information if we believe in good faith that it's necessary to [#p(user security) prevent serious harm to a person]. To [#p(requirements) enforce our policies and rights] . We may [#a disclose] information if [#p(requirements) needed to enforce our Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, or other policies], or to [#p(security) protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and others]. /} With our related companies . We may provide information to
our related companies, including parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership. Sale, Acquisition, or Transfer of Assets . {#s We may [#a disclose] information if Discord is [#p(sale) evaluating and/or engaging in a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale, transfer, or change in ownership] /}of Discord or any of its assets. [#ns Aggregated or de-identified information . We may disclose information that has been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we may share aggregated user statistics in order to describe our business to partners or the public.] ‍ Data retention {#s We [#a retain] [#dt personal information] until we determine it is no longer needed for the [#p(app functionality) processing purposes] for which we collected or [#a retain] it or for [#p(requirements) legal compliance]. /} [#ns You can learn more about data retention periods in
our data retention policy . ‍ How we protect your information We take a number of steps to help protect your information. All information sent within our services is encrypted both in transit and at rest. For example, we use Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) to encrypt text and images in transit. We also enforce technical and administrative access controls to limit which of our employees and contractors have access to nonpublic personal information. You can help maintain the security of your account by
configuring two-factor authentication . ‍ How to control your privacy We believe that users should be able to tailor their Discord experience to their preferences, including privacy. And while local laws may require different things, we believe that our users should have at least the same basic ability to shape their experience no matter where they are in the world. Here’s how you can control how we process your information, how to delete or correct certain information, and how to request access to your information. Users in certain places may have specific rights under their local laws. You can learn more about these in the relevant sections below. ‍ Be aware of the Discord spaces you choose to participate in You can choose what communities to participate in and what information you add to our services. You can choose what messages to send or post, who to engage with (e.g., one or more particular users or a potentially unlimited group of users), what information to include in your profile, whether to connect any third party services to your Discord account, and more. For example, if you share content in certain spaces, such as servers listed in Server Discovery or with public invite links, your content may be accessed by anyone.  ‍ Customize your personal Discord settings We offer a number of settings that allow you to tailor your experience within Discord. Some of these relate to specific features: for example, you can choose whether to display your current activity (like the game you are playing or the music you are listening to) in your status in your User Settings page (this is the gear icon next to your username). You can also access other privacy-specific settings in your User Settings. For example, you can decide which types of direct messages are scanned for explicit content, who can add you as a friend, and more. This is also where you can limit certain types of processing of your information: Limit our ability to use your data to improve our services . We offer certain settings that allow you to limit the information we collect to help us understand how users use our services, what features or products they may want, or to otherwise help us improve our business. If you turn off these settings, we will stop collecting and using certain event and log information as described in these settings. Limit our ability to personalize Discord for you . We offer certain settings that control whether and how we may personalize Discord for you, such as offering you relevant recommendations for in-app content and features. If these settings are disabled, we will stop collecting and using certain event and log information as described in these settings. You can learn more about these settings
in our Help Center . Disable or delete your account You can disable or delete your account via the User Settings menu. Disabling your account stops the processing of new data, but allows you to reactivate your account without interruption to you. Deleting your account permanently deletes identifying information and anonymizes other data as described in
our data retention policy . You can learn more about how to delete your account in
this Help Center article
and how to disable your account in
this Help Center article . Manage your content and servers You may edit or delete specific pieces of information within the services: You can edit or delete any message you have sent or content you have posted if you still have access to the space where you posted it. You can edit or delete a Discord server if you have the permissions needed to do so. You can edit or delete a channel from a Discord server if you have the permissions needed to do so. Content may be retained by Discord for use as described elsewhere in this policy and in
our data retention policy .] Also, in limited circumstances, {#s we may have a [#p(requirements:law compliance) legal obligation] to [#a retain] certain information /}, even if you delete the information or your account. [#ns Access your information If you want to see what information we have collected about you, you can request a copy of your data in the Privacy & Safety section of your User Settings. You should receive your data packet within 30 days. Data is delivered in common digital formats including CSV, JSON, and any other file format you used when uploading attachments to the services. You can learn more about how to access your information
in our Help Center . Manage cookies To control how information is collected and used from cookies on the services, you can take one or more of the following steps. You can disable and manage some cookies through your browser settings. You will need to manage your settings for each browser you use. You can find instructions for how to manage Cookies in popular browsers such as
Internet Explorer ,
Firefox ,
Chrome ,
Safari (iOS) ,
Safari (Mac) , and
Opera . To disable analytics cookies, you can use the browser controls discussed above or, for certain providers, you can use their individual opt-out mechanisms, such as Google Analytics Opt-Out. Your mobile device may also include browser settings to manage the use of cookies. Your device may also have settings to control the collection and use of information in your apps. Third party groups also enable you to limit] {#s how [#dt cookies] are [#a used] for [#p advertising purposes] by participating third parties /}. [#ns You can learn more at
Network Advertising Initiative , the
Digital Advertising Alliance , and for users in the EU, the
European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance . Depending on where you are accessing our services, you may be able to adjust your cookie preferences at any time through a cookies banner or by selecting “Cookie Settings” from the footer or menu on our website. If you disable or remove cookies, some parts of the services may not function properly. Information may be collected to remember your opt-out preferences. Questions or concerns about your privacy? You can email us at
privacy@discord.com . ‍ International data transfers We are based in the United States, and we process and store information on servers located in the United States. We may also store information on servers and equipment in other countries depending on a variety of factors, including the locations of our users and service providers. These data transfers allow us to provide our services to you. By accessing or using our services or otherwise providing information to us, you understand that your information will be processed, transferred, and stored in the U.S. and other countries, where different data protection standards may apply and/or you may not have the same rights as you do under local law. When transferring data outside the EEA, we use
standard contract clauses
(Module 1 and Module 2), and we rely on the European Commission's
adequacy decisions
about certain countries, as applicable, or other legally compliant mechanisms or conditions for such data transfer. Discord and its U.S. entities/subsidiaries (Backgammon Merger Sub II, LLC, Brazos Games, LLC, Discord International, Inc, Flames Sub LLC, and Sentropy Technologies Inc.) also comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks, as well as the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. If you have questions or complaints regarding our compliance with the Data Privacy Framework principles, please reach out to us at privacy@discord.com. If we do not resolve your complaint, you may submit your complaint free of charge to
JAMS . Under certain conditions specified by the Data Privacy Framework principles, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint. We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain circumstances, we may be liable for the transfer of personal data from the EU, Switzerland, or the UK to a third party outside those countries. For more information about the Data Privacy Framework principles and to view our certification, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s
Data Privacy Framework site . ‍ Services offered by third parties We allow third party developers to build certain features or other services and offer them within the Discord services. For example, server administrators can add “bots” created by third party developers that provide features like content moderation and interactive games. Similarly, you may have access to games or activities built by third parties within the services. These third-party services need to follow all policies that apply to them (including often our
Developer Terms of Service
and
Developer Policy ). As part of these policies, we require developers to have a privacy policy that makes clear what they do with your information. Please review these privacy policies, as they describe what bots and apps may do with your information. We also require that certain popular bots apply for access to certain data. But because these services are operated by third parties, we don’t control them or what information they collect. It’s up to you whether to participate in a server that uses bots, and whether to engage with third-party services in general. ‍ Data Protection Officer You can contact Discord Netherlands BV’s Data Protection Officer at
dpo@discord.com . We’ve appointed VeraSafe as Discord’s representative in the United Kingdom for data protection matters, pursuant to Article 27 of the UK General Data Protection Regulation. See the section “Contact Us” below. You can contact VeraSafe only on matters related to the processing of personal data. ‍ Information for Users in the EEA, United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Brazil Certain local laws, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Brazil’s Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD), require services to provide information about the information they collect, how they use it, and the lawful basis for processing it. We’ve described most of that already in the earlier portions of this Policy. ‍Exercising your rights:
As described in the “ How to control your privacy”
section above, all our users have control over their information and can directly edit or delete information from their account and limit what data we process.
