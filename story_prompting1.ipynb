      "We may collect this information directly from you when you register for an event or engage with our services and/or platforms. We may also collect this information from third party partners and public sources to the extent permitted by applicable data protection law. In some cases, the data we collect from third parties is provided in pseudonymised form and we are only able to connect it to you, if, and when you enter your email address on one of the Informa sites. Sensitive personal information\n",
      "If collecting or storing sensitive personal information such as information relating to health, beliefs or political affiliation, we will typically ask for your explicit consent. However, there are some limited situations where this will not occur, such as if you have an accident. If this does occur, we will ensure your privacy rights are protected. Children’s personal information\n",
      "Our services and products are directed at business professionals. They are not intended for children under the age of sixteen. We do not knowingly collect personal information from users in this age group and reserve the right to delete such information if we become aware of having collected it. If children’s data is collected, this is only via direct input from parents, guardians or teachers, and its usage is protected by clear licence terms aligned to applicable laws.\n",
      "How and why personal information is used\n",
      "This section explains how and why we use personal information. Product enquiries, sales and administration\n",
      "If you have made an enquiry about us or our products or services, either online or over the phone, your personal information will be used to respond to the enquiry or to take other steps at your request, prior to you entering into a contract with us. If you have purchased or registered for one of our products or services, including on a trial basis, we will use your personal information, including bank or card details, to provide you with the product or service, communicate with you about it, handle payments and recover any debts. Call monitoring for training and quality monitoring purposes\n",
      "Where one of our sales representatives speaks to you over the phone, the calls are recorded for training and monitoring purposes. To include professional information in our products and consulting services\n",
      "If your professional personal information is relevant to our products and is freely available through public sources, such as a website related to your work or profession, listed directories, press releases, industry publications, or if you provide it to us, to the extent permitted by applicable data protection laws, we may use such personal information in the products we provide to customers, for example in subscription products, research, industry analysis and insights. If you make an enquiry or engage us to provide consulting services or research/analysis, we will collect information such as your name, country, job title, company information or academic affiliation, postal address, e-mail address and telephone number. We will use your personal information to respond to the enquiry or to fulfil consulting services. For event and exhibition management\n",
      "If you participate in one of our events as a speaker, sponsor, exhibitor or attendee, your personal information will be used in connection with the running of the event, to handle payments and recover debts. We will also use your personal information to maintain databases that allow us to assess your qualities as a speaker or sponsor/exhibitor, promote events and encourage further engagement at our events. In addition, photos and videos are taken at our events, which may feature attendees, speakers, sponsors or exhibitors. Where we have taken photos and videos at our events that feature you as an attendee, sponsor or exhibitor, to the extent permitted by applicable data protection laws, those photos and videos may be used for promotional purposes. Where events and exhibitions use badge scanning technology, your personal information will be used to identify you at certain access points, such as to access VIP areas, seminars, entry and exit in other areas of the event. This will provide certain location information. Badges cannot be read remotely. The personal information obtained from badge scanning will be used for access control, security and analysing visitor traffic with a view to improving the event experience for visitors and others. You can also allow your badge to be scanned by event exhibitors. When you do so your contact details will be shared with the relevant exhibitor and used in accordance with applicable data protection laws, the exhibitor’s privacy policy and any other notices or consents you are provided with or given at the event. Where we are hosting and managing a virtual exhibition or event, Informa (and any third party platform provider acting on our behalf) will use your personal information provided during the registration process to host and manage this digital event; and also for analyzing visitor interactions and traffic with a view to improving the event experience for visitors and provide you with a personalized experience. When you enter virtual spaces, zones or rooms such as an exhibition booth, your personal information may be shared with the sponsor and exhibitor to allow them to engage with you subject to the attendee privacy notice you may have been provided during the registration and login process. For our Publishing Services\n",
      "If you publish work with us, your personal information, including the personal information of any named representative or beneficiary, is used in connection with the dissemination and promotion of your published work, and fulfilment of any contractual obligations, as is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests as a commercial organisation. Your name and affiliation will be published as part of authored work. Personal information is also used to handle payments or for other purposes, as is necessary to perform the contract entered into with us. In addition, we sometimes take photos and videos at events associated with your published work. Where photos and videos are taken at our events that feature you as an author, we may use those photos and videos for promotional purposes. For marketing\n",
      "The relevant Informa Controller may use your personal information to send you newsletters, offers or other marketing emails that keep you up to date with our news, events and products that may be of interest. Depending on the nature of your interaction with us and applicable data protection laws, you may have actively given us your consent (i.e. opted in) or we may be entitled to rely on your implied consent or legitimate interests to market to you. The opportunity to opt out of future marketing will always be provided, and you have the right to amend your marketing preferences at any time (see Your Rights section). Many of our events and products are co-branded or sponsored by third party exhibitors or sponsors. We may share your details with these third party partners. Where this happens, a clear notice will be provided, that gives the opportunity to opt out or opt in to such sharing as required by applicable data protection laws. The third party partner’s use of your details will be in accordance with the notice provided and its privacy policy, and is not covered by this Privacy Policy.\n",
      "For our client-facing marketing services\n",
      "Informa will combine the personal information that they collect from you, including much of the information in the “what we collect” section above, with personal data collected from certain trusted third party sources and use this information to create profiles in order to determine your/your company’s commercial interests. For example, we will collate the information you provide as part of your registration for events, information you generate in connection with your attendance at events, information obtained by us using first party cookies and tracking technology on our websites and apps and certain information we obtain from third parties (such as data providers) to analyse, segment and determine which marketing segments you fall within. This information can then be used by, or for the benefit of, our clients in different ways as part of our marketing service offering to enable these clients to undertake tailored and targeted advertising campaigns. Our clients can present individuals with information about products and services that our clients think will be of interest to them via various channels based on the marketing segments we have developed and allocated individuals to. In many cases these advertising campaigns are run by us on behalf of clients without us ever sharing any personal data with the relevant clients (including via marketing emails, and social media channels and our advertising partners who facilitate advertising on third party sites). In other cases, we may provide to clients information that the client is unable to use to identify you in order for them to instigate their own marketing campaigns. In all cases, our activities are undertaken to the extent permitted by applicable law. These activities are undertaken based on individuals’ marketing consents. Therefore, if you have exercised your rights to opt out of email marketing, you will not be marketed to in connection with the marketing services we provide to clients via any channel. The activities that we, and our third party partners, undertake may entail automated and machine learning-based processing of data to analyse or predict behaviours and preferences (e.g. interests in certain content, services and/or at events). The algorithm will identify companies and individuals with similar characteristics to companies and individuals that we know are interested in certain services, generating a similarity score for those clients. We will then enrich the information we hold about companies and individuals and send advertising to prospects based on this analysis. In social media\n",
      "We may use your personal information to undertake advertising campaigns on social media platforms such as LinkedIn, Instagram and Facebook in order to provide information about upcoming events or new products and to ensure you only receive relevant advertising about our products and services. We may share your personal information with social media platforms so that you see advertising about our, or our partners’, products and services that we think you will be interested in when you interact with the relevant social media platform. We may also share your personal information with social media platforms to help us present relevant advertising to individuals who the social media platforms determine are likely to have similar interests to you. We maintain presences on social media platforms, through our company and brand pages. We collect personal information when you interact with us on social media. Please note that these social media platforms may set cookies and other tracking technologies on your device when you visit their pages and when you navigate from their pages.

Our role may also differ depending on the specific situation involving Personal Information. We act in the capacity of a data controller when we ask you to submit your Personal Information that is necessary to ensure your access and use of the Mobile Application and Services. In such instances, we are a data controller because we determine the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Information. We act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you submit Personal Information through the Mobile Application and Services. We do not own, control, or make decisions about the submitted Personal Information, and such Personal Information is processed only in accordance with your instructions.

Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing by opting out, without having to rely on consent or any other of the legal bases. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.

      "Blueplate Open main menu Platform About Pricing Support Log in Blueplate Provisio version 1.11.0 Last updated 9/15/2023 Support Contact Information: 805.800.8050 support@blueplate.ai This terms of service goes over the terms of a relationship between the restaurant, Blueplate Holdings LLC (the provider) and you, the consumer. Privacy We collect consumer information, including but not limited to: Phone Number, Email, Spending and Site Visit Habits, Full name, and address. By making a purchase and inputting your information, you agree to us collecting, storing, and using your data in the following ways. 1: The restaurant may contact you regarding food items or order conditions, for example, to tell you a food item is unavailable, to adjust the fulfillment time, etc. 2: The restaurant and its employees will be able to see your basic information to make reference to your order, or to get in contact with you in case of any changes, or to provide you with order updates. Employees and owners are not allowed to contact customers for any other purposes than what is within reason to provide order updates. If you suspect abuse, please email support@blueplate.ai immediately. 3: You may be contacted by the Online Ordering Provider (Blueplate) to ask for your feedback regarding the online ordering system 4: You will be sent, by our automatic system, an order confirmation email if your order went through, and an emailed receipt by one of our payments partners. Your email may be stored by Sendgrid, a Twilio Product, but you will not be solicited offers by them, or receive marketing emails from them unless you sign up for the appropriate service. 5: You may receive an automatic feedback email from Blueplate. 6. You may receive general marketing communications from Blueplate, with an option to “opt out” or “unsubscribe” 7. Your data may be used in the aggregate to make informed decisions regarding overall consumer spending habits or site visit habits. 8. You may receive a confirmation text/pickup ready SMS text message. 9. We may use your data to market to you or people similar to you on our internal system. Your information is never revealed to the person being marketed to, to the public, or to third parties. For example, our system may determine that because of your spending habits, people like you may want to buy the same thing – we’d then recommend that person buys something because of the way you spent. We do not share your information with them. We may also market back to you based on your own spending habits. 10. We may use your data in the aggregate to make actionable insights in real time to other restaurants and their employees. For example, our system may use your spending habits to attempt to predict popular times and rush times, sharing this information with restaurant employees to prepare appropriately for when they might get busy. 11.We may use data about you to link actions across the platform and attribute them to you, for example if you use the same card or the same email address on two different platform actions, we’ll link them to your customer profile 12. We may collect data about your visit and site habits, such as what you click on, how you interact with the site, how long you visit for, and more. We may collect your IP address and other information regarding your internet connection, mostly for security purposes. Cookies and Device Storage We collect cookies, but not the kind you eat, as well as store information on your device. Everything Blueplate does related to cookies and device storage are for your convenience only, and shouldn’t affect your use of the service as a whole. We use cookies exclusively for authentication purposes. By storing cookies, we are able to securely, magically log you back in without you having to type in your username and password each and every time. By disabling cookies, you will not be able to persist your login, although the rest of the service should function fine. If you clear your cookies, you’ll lose any saved login details you may have had. We store information on your device specifically related to your visit and your site data. Most commonly, we’ll save your carts and abandoned carts so that just in case something happens, you don’t lose your order progress. If you disable local and session storage on your machine, the service will function fine, but your carts will be cleared on each visit, or if something out of the ordinary happens, such as a page crash, you’ll lose your progress. Cards and PCI As a facilitator of card transactions, we take card privacy, PCI compliance, and general security very seriously. Although our legal agreements with our processing partners (and general security concerns) prevent us from going fully into detail about what measures we take, we can say this: Card data is sent directly to our payment partners, and is never stored on our servers. Saved cards are stored managed by these partners. We follow and abide by ALL PCI regulations and standards. We accept the 4 major American Card brands: Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. We apply a 5.99% Convenience Fee to offset the restaurants cost of cards and help pay for the service. This fee is applied in compliance with convenience fee programs set by the card brands. Fulfillment Policy Orders that are recieved are prepared for the designated time provided. Please come to the pickup window and state your name. The associate may ask you to provide additional information for verification purposes. If your order is recieved but not ready, the restaurant will do their best in good faith to notify you when it will be ready. Enjoy! Occasionally, for reasons that are beyond our control, orders that are confirmed are not received. Power outages, network interruptions, severe weather, etc, may impact a restaurants ability to receive online orders.\n",
      "In this case, we’ll reconcile between all 3 parties (you, the restaurant, and Blueplate, the provider) will find the best solution to satisfy you. Our top priority is to ensure that your original intent (purchasing food items through our software) is fulfilled. If an order confirmation is given, that is our system telling us it did its job. In the case of an order being confirmed, our system has processed your order. In the case of an order confirmation going through, but the restaurant not receiving it, we typically look first at external sources such as power outages or network interruptions, such as internet service providers having a service outage. Our system does our best to ensure a reliable connection is made before confirming the order, but this isn’t (and can’t) always be the case. Some orders, as is with technology, may slip through the cracks and miss all filters and precautions put in place. We will reconcile with you and with the restaurant in this case to ensure everyone is satisfied. Delivery and Shipment Policy Blueplate does not offer delivery services – any order placed for delivery on the Blueplate network is fufilled by the restaurants own delivery drivers. Any and all delivery policies are to be deferred to that restaurant. Issues with and concerning delivery are typically deferred to the restaurant. Blueplate will attempt to fix any delivery errors in good faith, but as Blueplate does not offer delivery, we do not protect against any errors in this regard. In most cases, Blueplate is a pickup only service. Refund Policy In order to get a refund, please use the support and feedback center and get in contact diretly through those channels. We will provide a partial or full refund for a missing item, wrong item, or item that does not fall under normal standards, such as presence of hair. To cancel an order, please reach out as soon as possible. As ALL orders are made as soon as they are recieved, we may not be able to cancel all orders, but we will do our best in good faith to make things right.

      "Do-Not-Track (DNT) is a web browser setting that, when turned on, allows You to not have Your actions monitored online and stops all tracking activities. The DNT feature was first introduced in 2010 by the US Federal Trade Commission. By the end of 2011, it was adopted by most web browsers, but because it doesn’t carry any legal weight, it was never widely adopted. Since no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized, We do not currently respond to them or any other mechanisms that could communicate Your choice to not be tracked online. If the online-tracking standard is adopted in the future, We will notify You about such a change in Our revised version of this Privacy Policy. WILL WE UPDATE THIS PRIVACY POLICY? We reserve the right to update and change this Privacy Policy and practices from time to time. The changed Policy will have an updated “revised” date that will be visible on top of this page.

HOW INFORMATION IS USED, SHARED AND DISCLOSED DuyHt does not sell, and generally does not disclose, your Personal Information to third-parties without your consent. Except as set forth in Section 10 of this Privacy Policy, parents have the right to consent to collection and use of personal information from their child without also consenting to its disclosure to third-parties, as DuyHt does not share information that may be collected from your child. DuyHt uses Personal, Non-Personal and Financial Information, among other things, to monitor system performance, analyze internal business systems, improve the DuyHt Services, fulfill requests for additional products and services, contact you about promotional and marketing activities, provide customer support, and conduct research. The use and protection of information is an important component of DuyHt's business. Examples of how DuyHt shares and discloses your information is as follows: Legal. DuyHt may disclose information you provide to respond to subpoenas, court orders, requests from authorities, and other legal process, and to establish/exercise DuyHt's legal rights.

You understand and agree that DuyHt reserves the right to transfer any information collected from you in the case of any such transfer. In such event, DuyHt will use reasonable efforts to notify you before Personal Information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

DuyHt will provide such entities with access to certain information needed to perform their functions, but will take measures to ensure that they may not use it for other purposes. DuyHt shares information only as described above and with third-parties that are either subject to this Privacy Policy or to a privacy policy that is at least as protective as this Privacy Policy. 4. SECURITY The security of your Personal Information is important to DuyHt.

We will use your data to perform and process the contract on the use of Cash Giraffe. Within this framework, we will use your data primarily for the calculation and payment of the bonuses acquired by you in the course of your use of Cash Giraffe and inform you about apps participating in Cash Giraffe. Other use will only take place due to other statutory obligations or authorisation, if you have granted us permission, or if the use is for legitimate interests of justDice GmbH as the provider of Cash Giraffe. The legal basis for the processing of your data may be the following:\n",

      "“Your Rights as a Data Subject” . In particular, your personal data will be used as follows during the use of Cash Giraffe:\n",
      "Registration\n",
      "In order to use Cash Giraffe, you must register for Cash Giraffe. Consent to the Processing of Personal Data for the Use of Cash Giraffe\n",
      "When using Cash Giraffe for the first time, you first have to accept our terms and conditions of use (GTC) during the registration and agree to the processing of your personal data by Cash Giraffe.\n",
      "For this purpose, you have to confirm the following declaration of consent by clicking on the “ACCEPT” button underneath (if you do not want to give consent, please click on “REJECT”; the use of Cash Giraffe will then not be possible):\n",
      "I hereby agree that by using Cash Giraffe may use the following personal data:\n",
      "Registration data (email address, date of birth, gender)\n",
      "Installed apps (including the use duration and use history)\n",
      "The data is linked to your device via the device ID (GAID or IDFA) ransmitted to our servers in encrypted form. So that app providers can finance our app proposals, your device ID must be transferred to them for billing purposes. In order to measure the usage time as well as the installed apps, users can voluntarily upload screenshots from their mobile phone via the Cash Giraffe, after which they will be automatically processed, evaluated, and stored in our system for your membership. The processing of the above data is required in order to be able to suggest apps available in the Cash Giraffe that match your interests, propose their installation via system notifications, and allow the bonuses earned from using said apps to be calculated. I am aware that the above data results in an interest profile, which, depending on the type of apps I use, may contain particularly sensitive personal data (such as health data or data on my sexual orientation as well as any other data from special categories defined in Art. 9 para. 1 of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If necessary,\n",
      "a selfie is required\n",
      "(only with bonus payment)\n",
      "I understand that for reasons of fraud prevention, bonuses that I earn through the use of Cash Giraffe will only be possible after additional user verification via a selfie taken with my device's camera when I first request a bonus. My consent to the processing of my personal data therefore already applies to the processing of these photos. I acknowledge that selfies are also special-category personal data per Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR and expressly consent to the processing described below. We use users' selfies exclusively for the purpose of fraud prevention and to ensure that bonuses have not been earned through the automated, fraudulent use of software. For this purpose, a photo (“selfie”) is saved when your face is recorded using your device's camera. We use the recording to create an individual and anonymous digital user ID (in the form of a hash value) that is not linked to your account and is used to check whether the bonus has actually been earned by a real person and whether this person has already requested or received a bonus with another account. For reasons of data economy, this is only necessary if you want to receive bonuses. If you do not want to receive bonuses, you can use Cash Giraffe fully without providing any selfies. The selfies will not be used by us for any other purposes and we will delete them 4 weeks after your bonus has been disbursed. Information about Withdrawing Consent\n",
      "The withdrawal of your consent and the termination of the use of Cash Giraffe is possible at any time with future effect, and can be sent to justDice GmbH via email at contact@appstation.online or by post to justDice GmbH, An der Alster 42, 20099 Hamburg. Special fees (beyond the regular transmission fees of your telephone or internet service provider, or letter postage) do not apply for the withdrawal of consent. If you withdraw your consent, your data will be deleted from the Cash Giraffe database; if deletion is not possible, the processing of your data will be restricted instead of its being deleted. Further use by Cash Giraffe is no longer possible after the withdrawal of your consent. Registration and Registration via Facebook or Google Login\n",

The registration therefore serves to provide the services of Cash Giraffe and calculate the bonuses generated by you.

This includes (if we have not already collected and stored this in accordance with the steps described above, see above) the following information:\n",
      "Payment data : Email address of a PayPal account or details for other payment providers that are supported by Cash Giraffe. Selfies : For reasons of fraud prevention, bonuses that users earn through the use of Cash Giraffe will only be possible after additional user verification via a selfie taken with their device's camera when they first request a bonus.

Use Data\n",
      "During the use of Cash Giraffe, we log and store certain data automatically. Data Processing for the Recommendation of New Apps\n",

In order to know your long-term preferences and continue to offer you interesting apps, after the installation of Cash Giraffe and permanently during the use of Cash Giraffe, other apps installed by you on your end device will be automatically recognised by Cash Giraffe and the name of each newly installed app will be sent to us. In addition, we will log data about the use of the apps running in the foreground of your end device and the temporal extent of the use (date, time and duration of the use of all apps). For the logging of the use data within Cash Giraffe, we measure the so-called “customer journey”. For this purpose, each click or typing of a key within Cash Giraffe will be logged and linked to your profile or stored on the server. The processing of this data takes place based on the consent granted by you (see above) and serves to perform the contract on the use of Cash Giraffe by you.\n",

      "We also use the data about your use of the apps running in the foreground of your end device to calculate the bonuses generated by you, if you have obtained and installed these apps via Cash Giraffe. For this purpose, we also log and use data about your purchases of services and virtual items within the framework of the apps used by you (in-app purchases), and about relevant in-app occurrences relevant for the calculation of the bonuses, such as level increases. The processing of this data takes place based on the consent granted by you (see above) and serves to perform the contract on the use of Cash Giraffe by you. Use Data about the End Device Used by You\n",

This includes the so-called Google Advertiser ID (“GAID” for Android) and the so-called Apple Identifier for Advertisers (“IDFA” for Apple iOS), the Widevine ID, the model and product name of your end device, the version of the operating system, the browser type used and its display resolution, as well as the IP address allocated to your end device and information about when which content from our offering was accessed, the names of the files requested, and their dates and times of access. We require this data to determine the content requested by you (e.g. text, images, games and product information as well as files provided for download etc. ), in order to enable the offering of our services in accordance with the terms and conditions of use, and for the optimal display of Cash Giraffe on your end device. In order for app providers to finance our app suggestions, they must be sent the device ID for billing purposes.

This data is solely for the needs-based design of Cash Giraffe and therefore to constantly improve our services, and detect and rectify any security flaws. This data does not enable matches to be made to you personally. The processing of this data will take place to safeguard legitimate interests of justDice GmbH as the provider of Cash Giraffe. Note: Authorisation to Access Functions and Data on the End Device\n",
      "In order to be able to use all functions of Cash Giraffe, you may have to grant Cash Giraffe permission to access certain functions and data on your device (such as access to your camera or your app library), but this depends on your device and the operating system, over which we have no influence. We will use all authorisation granted by you solely for the above-named purposes, even if authorisation granted (e.g. for technical reasons) theoretically enables other possible uses. You can normally (in other words, depending on your device and the installed operating system) cancel granted authorisation in your device settings at any time. Contact Section\n",

      "If you send us a query, we will process your personal data for the duration of the processing of your query. When we no longer require your personal data, we will erase it from our systems and records, or anonymise it so that it can no longer be identified. We can retain certain personal data in order to comply with our statutory and regulatory obligations, and to enable us to manage our rights (e.g. the assertion of our rights in court), or for statistical purposes. Forwarding of Data\n",
      "The passing on of your personal data without your explicit prior permission will only take place in the following cases, in addition to the other cases named in this Data Privacy Statement:\n",
      "If necessary for the resolution of unlawful use or misuse of Cash Giraffe or for prosecution, personal data will be passed on to the criminal prosecution authorities and, if necessary, to third parties who have been harmed. However, this will only take place if there are specific indications of unlawful conduct or misuse. We are also legally obliged to provide information to certain public bodies upon request. These are criminal prosecution authorities, authorities that pursue administrative offences punishable by a financial penalty, and the financial authorities. The forwarding to third parties bound to professional secrecy can only take place if this is necessary for the implementation of the Cash Giraffe terms and conditions of use or other agreements, and our claims from the contract on the use of Cash Giraffe. For the provision of our service, we are occasionally reliant on contractually bound third-party companies and external service providers, e.g. for our customer service and the hosting of Cash Giraffe. In such cases, information will be passed on to these companies or individual people in order to enable further processing. These external service providers are carefully selected by us and checked regularly, to ensure that your privacy remains protected, and they may only process the data for the purposes specified by us. They are also contractually obliged by us to only handle your data exclusively in accordance with this Data Privacy Statement and the German data privacy laws. As part of the further development of our business, the structure of our company may change, in that the legal form is changed, or subsidiary companies, business units or components are founded, purchased or sold. In the event of such transactions, the customer information will be passed on, together with the part of the company to be transferred, with your consent. During any transfer of personal data to third parties to the specified extent, we will ensure that the further use takes place in accordance with this Data Privacy Statement and the relevant data protection laws, and we will ask for your permission. Security Measures to Protect the Data Stored by Us\n",
      "We are obliged to protect your privacy and treat your personal data confidentially. Your data will be stored in our databases, which are only accessible to us and employees specifically trained in data protection. If we use support from third-party service providers who process your data on our behalf in order to provide our web services, we have ensured that they are subject to the strict conditions of this Data Privacy Statement, and that the use of your data beyond the cases described in this Data Privacy Statement will not take place. All contractors, service providers and their employees are subject extensively to our instructions and are also in particular legally obliged to observe, and trained in, the protection of your data. In order to prevent the loss or misuse of the data stored by us, we take comprehensive technical and organisational safety precautions, which are regularly reviewed and adjusted to meet technological advances. If it is within our sphere of influence, we use in particular modern encryption techniques as well as a variety of other measures to prevent third parties from obtaining unauthorised information. However, we would like to point out to you that due to the structure of the internet, it is possible that the data protection regulations and the above-named security measures of other persons or institutions not within our area of responsibility cannot be observed. In particular, data passed on in a non-encrypted form can be read by third parties, even if it is sent via email. We have no technical influence on this occurrence. In these cases, it is the responsibility of the user to protect the data it provides against misuse, by encryption or other methods. Data Storage Abroad\n",
      "We consistently ensure the strict data protection made legally binding in the European Union. In some cases, particularly for technical reasons, it may transpire that your data entrusted to us is stored on servers outside of your country (even outside of the European Union) in which you originally entered your data. In this case and in the case of a risk that countries to which your data are sent are not subject to data protection law that is just as strict as that in your home country and in the country from which you use our services, we ensure that your data is handled in accordance with the provisions of this Data Privacy Statement.
