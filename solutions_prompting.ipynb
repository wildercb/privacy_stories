      "{'abstract.txt': '5 Abstract\\nLimit as much as possible the detail in which personal data\\nis processed.\\nWhile â\\x80\\x98minimiseâ\\x80\\x99 forces one to decide whether or not to process a particular piece of personal data, â\\x80\\x98abstractâ\\x80\\x99 addresses the more subtle question\\nof the level of detail in which to process personal data. The less detailed\\na personal data item is, the more we â\\x80\\x98zoom outâ\\x80\\x99, the lower the privacy\\nrisk is.\\n5.1 Tactics\\nProcessing personal data in less detail can be done both at the data subject\\nlevel as well as the attribute level. The following three tactics apply.\\nSummarise Summarise detailed attributes into more coarse-grained, general attributes. For example, use an age category instead of a birth\\ndate, or a city of residence instead of a full address, whenever possible.\\nGroup Aggregate information about a group of people instead of processing personal information for each person in the group separately. Compile group profiles with average information concerning\\nthe members of the group.\\nPerturb Do not process the exact value of a personal data item. Instead\\nuse an approximation of that value, or adjust the value with some\\nrandom noise. For example, instead of reporting the exact current\\nlocation of a person, report his location within some random distance from the real location.\\nDetailed information often becomes less relevant over time. Detailed logs\\nare necessary to act swiftly in case of a hack or a disruption, but after\\nsome time only an aggregate overview of the total number of users of\\na service (perhaps with some information about which specific parts of\\nthe service were used) is still relevant. Be aware of this, and clean logs\\naccordingly.\\n10\\nNote that even group profiles pose a privacy risk when individuals can\\neasily be classified to belong to a particular group (such as people with a\\ncertain medical condition, or with a certain financial risk profile).\\n5.2 Examples\\nIn many cases (like special discounts for seniors or juniors, or rules that\\nrequire one to check whether someone is an adult) only age matters, and\\nnot the particular date of birth. In these cases it suffices to record the\\nattribute â\\x80\\x9cover eighteenâ\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9csenior citizenâ\\x80\\x9d.\\nSmart meters are an example of a system that abstracts both over space\\nas well as over time. For the stability of the electrical grid detailed information on energy use of a single household is not relevant. It suffices to\\nmonitor, in real time, energy use of a whole street or block of houses. To\\ndetermine the electricity bill it is not necessary to record the energy use\\nin real time. Instead it is sufficient to send the accumulated energy use\\nof say three months at a time to the energy supplier.\\nHomomorphic encryption allows one to perform calculations on encrypted\\ndata without learning the real (unencrypted) data themselves. This allows\\none party to compute the sum of a set of encrypted measurements. Another party can then decrypt this sum. At the same time no one learns\\nanything about the individual measurements.\\nLocation-based services need the location of the user in order to show relevant information (like a nearby restaurant, for example). But depending\\non the service this location does not have to be exact. Precise GPS coordinates are usually not necessary. Sometimes a coarse location rounded to\\na square kilometre suffices, and sending all relevant data for that larger\\narea to the device. The more detailed information is filtered out locally.\\nThis type of clustering or cloaking implements the k-anonymity principle.\\nThis principle demands that the data is perturbed or cloaked in such a way\\nthat it could apply to at least k different people, that are also represented\\nin the data set, or are using the service. In other words: apart from you,\\nthe data could belong to at least k â\\x88\\x92 1 other people. In location based\\nservices, k depends on the size of the area, and the average number of\\npeople there.', 'control.txt': '8 Control\\nProvide data subjects adequate control over the processing\\nof their personal data.\\nControl is a fundamental principle to protect the privacy of users. The\\nmain goal of privacy is not to totally prevent the processing and sharing\\nof personal data. Not at all! But users want to have control and have a\\nsay in how their personal data is processed and shared.\\n8.1 Tactics\\nUsers get control over the processing of their personal data through one\\nof the following tactics.\\nConsent Ask users explicit consent to the processing of their personal\\ndata. Inform them beforehand exactly about which personal data\\nwill be processed, how they will be processed and for which purpose (â\\x80\\x98informed consentâ\\x80\\x99, see also the inform strategy). It should\\nbe possible to withdraw consent.\\nChoose Offer users a real choice: basic functionality should be accessible\\nfor people who do not consent to the processing of their personal\\ndata. Offer a (paid) alternative.\\nUpdate Offer users the means to review and update the personal data\\ncollected about them. A logical approach is to combine this with\\nthe approach that allows users to view the personal data collected\\n(e.g. through a dashboard).\\nRetract Offer users a means to retract (or to ask for the deletion of) their\\npersonal information. Again, this can be part of a privacydashboard.\\nConsent is not always required when processing personal data, for example when you have a legitimate interest to process it. Always consult a\\nlawyer to make sure.\\nIt is not always possible or even required to allow users to correct their\\ndata or to delete their data when they ask you to. Sometimes personal\\ndata are simply required to be retained. In medical records it is undesir16\\nable to allow patients to edit entries with medical significance.\\n8.2 Examples\\nIn many cases processing personal data is simply allowed, for example\\nbecause they are strictly necessary to execute a contract (e.g. the postal\\naddress is required when ordering something on-line) or because there\\nis a legal requirement to do so (e.g. banks verifying your identity). In\\nother cases consent is required. Inform users clearly about the purposes.\\nAnd offer them a real choice (so that they do get access even when they\\ndo not agree, perhaps to a limited part of the service). Use opt-in (no\\nprocessing without prior consent) instead of opt-out (processing takes\\nplaces, unless consent is withdrawn at a later stage): the default choice\\ndoes not constitute consent. So donâ\\x80\\x99t use pre-checked checkboxes to\\nsubscribe people to newsletters, for exampleâ\\x80¦\\nWebsites have to ask permissions to place cookies. Many of the â\\x80\\x98accept\\ncookiesâ\\x80\\x99 notifications do not comply: they do not offer a real choice as the\\nwebsite cannot be visited unless the cookie is accepted. A proper cookie\\nstatement offers a real choice to accept cookies, and offers the option to\\nchoose which cookies to accept or not (e.g. those needed for anonymous\\nwebsite statistics, or those used to connect with social networks).\\nA radically different approach shifts the control of the personal data completely to the users themselves. Instead of organisations storing the personal data for all their customers, they ask their customers to each store\\nthat data themselves. The organisations later access that information\\nthrough a standard interface, under the control of the user. This is sometimes called â\\x80\\x98customer managed relationsâ\\x80\\x99 as opposed to â\\x80\\x98customer relations managementâ\\x80\\x99.\\n', 'demonstrate.txt': '10 Demonstrate\\nDemonstrate you are processing personal data in a privacyfriendly way.\\nThis strategy addresses the new requirement that organisations need to\\ndemonstrate compliance to privacy regulations. The demonstrate strategy is externally oriented, towards the data protection authorities (possibly through the internal data protection officer).\\n10.1 Tactics\\nThe following tactics help organisations to demonstrate compliance.\\nRecord Document all (important) steps taken. Record decisions, and motivate them. Collect system logs (and respond to anomalies)1\\n.\\nAudit Audit the logs regularly, but audit also the organisational processes in general, and the way personal data is processed within\\nthe organisation.\\nReport Report the results of such audits to the Data Protection Authority\\n(DPA), or keep them for later reference. Consult, when possible, the\\nDPA regularly.\\nDocument extensively yet efficiently the ways in which the organisation\\nprotects personal information. Do so in a surveyable and clarifying manner. Make sure that the documentation corresponds with reality. Get\\ncertified.\\n10.2 Examples\\nPerforming a data protection impact assessment (DPIA), and especially\\nrecording the findings and properly documenting the decisions made\\nbased on it, is a good starting point. A DPIA has to be performed when\\npersonal will be processed. Sometimes a limited DPIA suffices. When\\nthis indicates that significant privacy risks may arise, a full-fledged DPIA\\n1This tactic was called â\\x80\\x98logâ\\x80\\x99 in earlier work.\\n20\\nmust be performed. A DPIA must be repeated every once in a while as\\ncircumstances may have changed.\\nAnother approach is to get certified against an (internationally) recognised standard for privacy friendliness (like TRUSTe or EuroPriSe). Alternatively, a benchmark with other organisations that operate within the\\nsame (business)sector could provide additional support for the privacy\\nmaturity of your organisation.\\nUsing formal methods and structured development environments when\\ndeveloping new systems is an advantage.\\n', 'enforce.txt': '9 Enforce\\nCommit to processing personal data in a privacy-friendly\\nway, and adequately enforce this.\\nPrivacy should not only be guaranteed through technical means, but also\\nthrough organisational means. It should be part of the organisational\\nculture and be propagated by higher management. Otherwise nobody\\nwill feel responsible. A clear privacy policy will provide scope and guidance. The enforce strategy is internally oriented, towards the organisation itself. The strategy ensures that the externally communicated privacy\\nstatement (see the inform strategy) is also enforced internally through a\\nprivacy policy.\\n9.1 Tactics\\nPrivacy-friendly processing is enforced by applying the following tactics.\\nCreate The organisation should commit to privacy. Take responsibility.\\nCreate a privacy policy. Assign resources to execute this policy.\\nDetermine for each process the goal and the (legal) ground: is there\\na legitimate interest, or is consent required? Be clear about the\\nbusiness model.\\nMaintain Maintain the policy with all the necessary technical and organisational controls. Implement these controls. Assign responsibilities. Create an awareness campaign and train all personnel. Make\\nsure third parties (processors) also comply with the policy.\\nUphold Circumstances change. Verify the privacy policy regularly, and\\nadjust its implementation whenever necessary. Establish prior criteria, and evaluate your policy against them.\\nThe privacy policy should be aligned with the overall business plan and\\nmission statement of the organisation. Make sure it is consistent with all\\nother organisational policies.\\n18\\n9.2 Examples\\nOne approach is to implement a privacy management system similar to\\nthe plan-do-check-act cycle from the information security management\\nstandard (ISO 27001). This could be integrated with the data protection\\nimpact assessments that have to be performed anyway (and that are further discussed under the demonstrate strategy).\\nAnother technical approach is the use of so called â\\x80\\x99sticky policiesâ\\x80\\x99 that\\nare attached a data item to indicate the original purpose for which the\\ndata item was collected, or to specify the processing that is allowed to be\\nperformed on the data item. Processes in the organisation are set up in\\nsuch a way that for each data item the sticky policy associated with it is\\nautomatically verified.\\nOne could also consider the use of techniques that register â\\x80\\x99unusualâ\\x80\\x99 activity and that block access to data items when necessary, for example\\nwhen one person tries to access an unusual amount of data, or if significantly many people access a particular data item (for example the medical\\nrecords of a VIP).\\nConsideration should also be given to the system development processes\\nwithin your organisation. Adhere to the privacy by design philosophy,\\nand address privacy from the start. This little book helps you with that!\\n;-) If you do not develop your own systems, privacy by design thinking, and\\nin particular the use of the privacy design strategies, also helps setting\\nthe requirements for products or services to be procured.\\n', 'hide.txt': '6 Hide\\nProtect personal data, or make it unlinkable or unobservable. Make sure it does not become public or known.\\nThis important strategy targets the confidentiality, unlinkability and unobservability of personal data. This is in contrast to the minimise strategy that is aimed at explicitly deciding whether or not to process certain\\npersonal data at all. The adequate protection of personal data is a legal\\nrequirement.\\n6.1 Tactics\\nThe hide strategy therefore contains the following tactics.\\nRestrict Restrict access to personal data. Ensure personal data is properly protected. Setup a strict access control policy. Only allow access to those who really need it (the â\\x80\\x98need to knowâ\\x80\\x99 principle). Make\\nit difficult to accidentally share or leak personal data.\\nObfuscate Prevent understandability of personal data to those without\\nthe ability to decipher it. Encrypt data so that it becomes unintelligible without the key. Hash personal data, e.g. to create a pseudonym.\\nDissociate Break the link and remove the correlation between events,\\npersons, and data. Remove directly identifying data.\\nMix Mix personal data to hide the source or their interrelationships. Anonymise data. Hide data in a â\\x80\\x98cloudâ\\x80\\x99 of other data. Break the correlation between two events, for example by not responding immediately. Collect a few events first, and then process them in bulk.\\nHiding personal data can be achieved by protecting it (you know it is there\\nbut you cannot access it), making it unlinkable (you know the data, but\\nnot to which person it belongs), or making it unobservable (you are not\\neven aware of the existence of the data). This latter aspect is only relevant\\nto behavioural data (metadata), like location data, or information about\\nwho is communicating with whom.\\n12\\nTypically a combination of the above tactics is used to hide a particular\\ndata item.\\n6.2 Examples\\nHashing and encryption are standard cryptographic techniques that one\\ncan use to protect personal data. Use them both for data transmitted over\\nnetworks (â\\x80\\x98data in transitâ\\x80\\x99) as for data stored somewhere (â\\x80\\x98data at restâ\\x80\\x99),\\nand also pay proper attention to key management.\\nSome communication services and cloud storage services use end-to-end\\nencryption. In this case users agree, in a secure manner, on the keys to\\nuse for encryption in such a way that the service provider does not learn\\nthe key. This ensures that the service provider cannot decrypt and read\\nthe data it stores or forwards. The data is only available at the â\\x80\\x98endpointsâ\\x80\\x99\\n(i.e. the smartphone or laptop) of the users themselves.\\nAttribute-based credentials (ABCs) allow a privacy-friendly form of identity management. Attributes are personal qualities, such as name, age,\\nweight, income, etc. Using ABCs you can prove you possess such an attribute, for example that you are over eighteen, without revealing any\\nother piece of information about yourself. Moreover, ABCs are unlinkable: reuse of a credential cannot be detected. If you prove a hundred\\ntimes to the same service provider that you are over eighteen, then as\\nfar as the service provider is concerned, a hundred different people over\\neighteen used its service.\\nTor, the onion router, makes web browsing anonymous. Your browser\\nno longer connects to the web server directly. Instead the connection is\\nestablished through three different Tor nodes. These intermediate connections are all encrypted. This way the web server, your internet service\\nprovider, any intermediate nodes, even the Tor nodes you use, cannot tell\\nwhich websites you are visiting.\\nNote that in practice completely anonymous data sets do not exist: often one can use the retained data elements to deduce the identity of the\\nperson they pertain to. Therefore do not rely on anonymisation entirely.\\n', 'inform.txt': '7 Inform\\ni\\nInform data subjects about the processing of their personal\\ndata in a timely and adequate manner.\\nTransparency about which personal data is being processed, how they are\\nprocessed and for which purpose, is an essential prerequisite for better\\nprivacy protection. It allows users to take informed decisions about using\\na system and agreeing to the processing of their personal data (see also\\nthe control strategy). Moreover it allows society at large to verify whether\\norganisations are processing our personal data responsibly. (â\\x80\\x9cSunlight is\\nsaid to be the best of disinfectants.â\\x80\\x9d)\\n7.1 Tactics\\nTransparency can be achieved following these tactics.\\nSupply Supply information about which personal data is processed, how\\nthey are processed, and why. Clearly specify how long personal\\ndata is retained, and how it is deleted. List all third parties with\\nwhich you share this personal data, be clear about the conditions\\nthat cover each third party data exchange, and specify how these\\nconditions are enforced. Put a link to your privacy policy on your\\nhomepage, and in your app. Clearly indicate how people can get in\\ntouch with questions about their privacy.\\nExplain Explain which personal data you process, and why. Argue why\\nthis is necessary. Do this in a clear and easy to understand manner, even for a layperson. Target this information to different user\\ngroups: novices, experts, the authorities. Consider using a layered\\napproach: first provide an overview, and provide links to more detailed information.\\nNotify Notify users (in real time) the moment you process their personal\\ndata, share it with third parties, or as soon as you become aware of\\na data leak. Prepare clear procedures for this. Make notifications\\nshort but informative. Be sure not to notify too often. Allow users\\nto control for which events they wish to receive a notification.\\n14\\nInforming users about the processing of their personal data (through a\\nprivacy statement) presupposes that there is a privacy policy in place\\n(see the enforce strategy) on which the processing is based. Moreover,\\nthis information must be complete and up-to-date. This is harder than it\\nfirst appears.\\nSeveral years ago we, together with a few students, performed\\nan experiment to test data subject access rights. The results\\nwere astounding. We received literally screenshots from databases. One student even got a phone call from the help desk of\\nhis mobile phone company. The poor help desk person asked\\nhim whether he really wanted to pursue his data subject access\\nrequest, as it would take hours if not days to complete. This is\\nwhat happens when you do not develop your system with such\\naccess requests in mind.\\n7.2 Examples\\nThe set of icons created by the Creative Commons can be used to summarise the copyrights associated with a particular document. Similarly,\\nprivacy pictograms can communicate the essence of a privacy policy at\\na glance. For example these icons could indicate which type of personal\\ndata is processed, where they are processed, and whether they are shared\\nwith third parties (and if so, with whom).\\nA personal privacy dashboard clearly shows to the users which data are\\ncollected, how they are processed, for which purpose, and with whom\\nthey have been shared. Companies like Google have implemented such\\nprivacy dashboards. Make sure the access to this dashboard is tightly\\nsecured!\\nAppleâ\\x80\\x99s iOS shows a notification icon in the status bar whenever an application accesses the location services. This is an example of an â\\x80\\x98ambient\\nnotificationâ\\x80\\x99: the user is informed in a subtle, non-invasive, way about the\\nuse of his personal data.\\n1', 'minimize.txt': '3 Minimise\\nLimit as much as possible the processing of personal data.\\nThe most obvious strategy to protect privacy is to minimise the collection of personal data. Nothing can go wrong with data you do not collect:\\nthey cannot be abused, they cannot be misused, or get leaked accidentally.\\nThink carefully about the personal data you really need. Sometimes a radically different approach may lead to a design that requires significantly\\nless data, or may require no personal data at all.\\n3.1 Tactics\\nMinimisation of personal data can be achieved by collecting data of less\\npeople, or collecting less data of people. Several different tactics are\\napplicable.\\nSelect Select only relevant people and relevant attributes. Determine beforehand which people and which attributes are relevant, and process only that data. Process only incoming data that satisfies the\\nselection criteria. Be conservative when establishing the selection\\ncriteria: only select what is strictly necessary. Use a white-list.\\nExclude Exclude people or attributes in advance. Determine beforehand\\nwhich people or attributes are irrelevant. Do not process that data\\nor immediately throw it away if you happen to receive it. Be liberal\\nin grounds for exclusion: exclude as much as possible, unless you\\nare certain, and can justify, that you need it. Use a black-list.\\nStrip Remove (partial) data as soon as it is no longer necessary. Determine beforehand the time you need a particular data item, and ensure it gets automatically deleted as soon as this time expires. If\\nthe data item is part of a larger data record, update the field to a\\ndefault value indicating it is unspecified. Changes in organisation,\\nprocesses or services may render certain data items irrelevant before their expiry time. Prune them.\\nDestroy Completely remove personal data as soon as they are no longer\\nrelevant. Ensure that the data cannot be recovered, even in unforeseen ways. Do not rely on logical removal strategies, that only block\\n5\\nthe access to the data, but leave (traces of) the data still accessible\\nto skilful attackers. Remove data from backups as well, and use\\nsecure ways to erase data from hard disks.\\nConsidering minimisation forces you to think carefully about the fundamental values of your organisation and the core business you are in. â\\x80\\x9cA\\ncobbler should stick to his lastâ\\x80\\x9d: if you are not in the primary business of\\nprofiling your customers for say advertising purposes, you should stay\\naway from that. Minimisation forces you to be specific about your purposes; donâ\\x80\\x99t be tempted to phrase them broadly.\\nIn 2014 ING, a large Dutch bank, decided to offer third parties\\nthe opportunity to reach its bank account holders with targeted\\nadvertising, based on their transaction histories. This caused\\nan uproar, and the bank quickly backtracked. ING customers\\nconsidered this a huge breach of trust: financial transactions\\nare quite sensitive, especially in the Netherlands where people do not easily share their financial situation or even their\\nsalaries.\\n3.2 Examples\\nExclusion or selection of data is not only relevant when collecting information, or when personal data is obtained in another way, but also when\\nusing already collected data. Ensure that internal processes and applications only use the personal data that are truly relevant. Ensure that\\nonly relevant data is shared with third parties. And take care when the\\nprocessing of personal data creates new personal data: select or exclude\\nalso in this case the new data that are truly (not) necessary.\\nData mining, deep learning and Big Data create new insights.\\nSelect only the insights that are relevant. Throw the others\\naway, and do not keep them because â\\x80\\x9cit doesnâ\\x80\\x99t hurt to tryâ\\x80\\x9d: it\\nsometimes does hurt.\\nIn other words, also when using, sharing, analysing and enriching data\\none has to consider ways to minimise the final set of personal data retained.\\n6\\nThe difference between stripping and destroying data is subtle: stripping\\nhappens in the application layer, while destroying focuses on the physical\\nstorage layer.\\nThere are tried-and-tested methods to truly erase and destroy data from\\nhard drives (for example by writing random data several times to each\\nof the sectors involved). An efficient method of destroying backups is\\nby encrypting the data before backing it up. By associating certain keys\\nwith particular retention periods, all data for a particular data can be\\ndestroyed by simply destroying the associated key.\\nA radically different system architecture may result in a much more privacy-friendly system. Consider for example a system for paying fees on\\ntoll roads. One approach would be to uniquely identify each passing\\ncar at each entrance and exit of the toll road. This would provide the\\noperator with detailed information about everybodyâ\\x80\\x99s driving habits: a\\nhuge breach of privacy. Another approach would be to install a small box\\nin each car that automatically deducts the required fee from an associated\\naccount.', 'seperate.txt': '4 Separate\\nSeparate the processing of personal data as much as\\npossible.\\nAnother important strategy is to (logically or physically) separate the processing of personal data. This makes it harder to combine or correlate\\ndata. By processing personal data from different contexts, the risk that\\ndata from one context becomes known in another context is reduced. Especially when the separation is physical. Hence separation implements\\ncontextual integrity.\\n4.1 Tactics\\nThe following two tactics help implement the separate strategy.\\nIsolate Collect and process personal data in different databases or applications. These databases or applications are either logically separated, or actually run on different (yet still centrally located or\\ncontrolled) hardware. Ensure that the logical separation is tightly\\nenforced.\\nDistribute Distribute the collection and processing of personal data over\\ndifferent physical locations using databases and systems that are\\nnot under the control of a single entity. Use the equipment (PC,\\nlaptop, smartphone) of the data subject himself as much as possible, and use central components as little as possible. Use decentralised or even distributed system architectures instead of centralised ones.\\n4.2 Examples\\nA social network allows people to share status updates and pictures with\\nfriends and acquaintances. Current social networks (such as Twitter or\\nFacebook) are centralised architectures: the platform sees everything that\\nits users share with each other. That also determines the (tremendous)\\nvalue of these social networks, and also underlies the business models\\n8\\nof these networks. A privacy-friendly version of such a social network\\nwould allow its users to store all updates and pictures locally on their\\nown devices (e.g their smartphones) and would share that information\\ndirectly with their friends and acquaintances in a peer-to-peer fashion.\\nIn this case no data is stored or processed by a centralised component at\\nall.\\nIn general peer-to-peer networks or distributed algorithms could be used\\ninstead of centralised approaches, to improve privacy protection.\\nOne small example to further illustrate this idea is the historical use of a passbook to record bank deposits or withdrawals,\\nback in the days when people did not have bank accounts and\\nwages were paid in cash. The passbook served as a local copy\\nof all transactions, owned and controlled by the holder. Strictly\\nspeaking only the passbook itself could have served as the authentic record, alleviating the bank of the need to maintain\\nany information about the â\\x80\\x98accountâ\\x80\\x99 and its holder. (In practice banks would have kept a record too to prevent fraud.)\\nAppleâ\\x80\\x99s iOS 10 allows users to group photos based on the people in them.\\nThis uses facial recognition software. In iOS 10 this software runs locally\\nin the userâ\\x80\\x99s phone. The photos are therefore not sent to a central server\\nfor analysis.\\nAn extremely privacy-friendly way of processing data in a distributed\\nfashion is the use of secure multiparty computation. With this technology\\nan arbitrary function over private inputs distributed over many different\\ndevices can be computed without these inputs ever leaving the devices.\\nThis technique has been used in Denmark to perform secure and privacyfriendly auctions. Every bid was secret, except the largest: that one could\\nbe determined.\\n'}\n"

      "Privacy issues can be resolved at several levels of abstractions. At the lowest level, privacy enhancing technologies implement specific privacy protection mechanisms. These technologies are important during the implementation phase. Design patterns are tools at a higher level of abstraction that \"describe a commonly recurring structure of communicating components that solves a general design problem within a particular context\". They apply to the design phase and do not necessarily play a role in the earlier, concept development and analysis, phases of the software development cycle. The main reason is that such design patterns are already quite detailed in nature, and more geared towards solving an implementation problem. To guide the development team in the earlier stages, privacy design strategies at a higher level of abstraction are needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Privacy design patterns can be mapped to privacy design strategies. This mapping is not unique: a pattern may implement more than one strategy. Similarly, privacy enhancing technologies implement one or more design patterns. By studying these mappings (of which the current research is just a first step) we can identify for which strategies adequate patterns are missing, and similarly, for which patterns new technologies need to be developed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deriving privacy design strategies\n",
      "A natural starting point to derive some privacy preserving strategies is to look at when and how privacy is violated, and then consider how these violations can be prevented. We have taken Daniel Solove's taxonomy (Solove, D.J. A taxonomy of privacy. University of Pennsylvania Law Review 154, 3 (2006), 477-564) as point of departure here. His general subdivision of activities that affect privacy (information collection, information processing, information dissemination and invasions) inspired us to look at IT systems at a higher level of abstraction to determine where and how privacy violations can be prevented.\n",
      "\n",
      "Current data protection legislation in general views an IT system as an information storage system, i.e. a database system where personal identifiable information about people is stored in one or more database tables. Applying this legislation to such systems, the following general observations can be made. Data collection should be minimised, for example by not storing individual rows in a database table for each and every individual, and the number of attributes stored should correspond to the purpose. Data collected for one purpose should be stored separately from data stored for another purpose, and linking of these database tables should not be easy. When data about individuals is not necessary for the purpose, only aggregate data should be stored. Personal data should be properly protected, and strict access control procedures should limit access to authorised persons only. A data subject should be informed about the fact that data about her is being processed, and she should be able to request modifications and corrections where appropriate. In fact the underlying principle of information self-determination dictates the she should be in control. Finally, the collection and processing of personal data should be done in accordance to a privacy policy, that should be actively enforced. The current proposal for the revision of the European privacy directive (into a regulation) also stresses the fact that data controllers should be able to demonstrate compliance with data protection legislation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Privacy-principles-db-metaphor.gif\n",
      "\n",
      "Given this analysis form the legal point of view, we see we can distinguish the following eight privacy design strategies: minimise, separate, abstract, hide, inform, control, enforce and demonstrate. A graphical representation of these strategies, when applied to a database system, is given in this figure. In the full paper we also show that these strategies cover the privacy principles of the ISO 29100 Privacy framework, and we verify that the strategies can also be easily understood in the context of information flow systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The eight privacy design strategies\n",
      "Strategy #1: Minimise\n",
      "Limit as much as possible the processing of personal data.\n",
      "By ensuring that no, or no unnecessary, data is collected, the possible privacy impact of a system is limited. Data minimisation can take two forms: either a yes/no decision to collect any information about individuals is made (as a consequence, for some people no information will be collected at all), or the amount of information that is collected about each person is restricted to a limited set of characteristics. A common design pattern is select before you collect, anonymisation, and the use of pseudonyms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Strategy #2: Separate\n",
      "Separate the processing of personal data as much as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "By separating the processing or storage of several sources of personal information that belong to the same person, complete profiles of one person cannot be made. The strategy of separation calls for distributed processing instead of centralised solutions. In particular, data from separate sources should be stored in separate databases, and these databases should not be linked if not needed. Data should be processed locally whenever possible, and stored locally if feasible as well. Database tables should be split when possible (and links between rows should be hard to find).\n",
      "\n",
      "These days, with an emphasis on centralised, web based, services, this strategy is often disregarded. Further investigations into design pattern that implement the separate strategy are required, especially those that will satisfy business needs that usually steer towards a centralised solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strategy #3: Abstract\n",
      "Limit as much as possible the detail in which personal data is processed.\n",
      "By restricting the amount of detail of personal information, or by considering this information at the group level instead of considering this information for each person separately, this personal information becomes less sensitive. When the information is sufficiently coarse grained, and the size of the group over which it is aggregated is sufficiently large, little information can be attributed to a single person, thus protecting its privacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Common design patterns are aggregation over time (for example used to provide some level of privacy protection in smart metering and smart grid systems), dynamic location granularity (used in location based services where the accuracy of the reported location of a user is adapted dynamically to ensure that a reasonable number of other users are at the same location).\n",
      "\n",
      "Strategy #4: Hide\n",
      "Protect personal data, or make it unlinkable or unobservable. Make sure it does not become public or known.\n",
      "The rationale behind this strategy is that by hiding personal information from plain view, it cannot easily be abused. The strategy does not directly say from whom the data should be hidden. And this depends on the specific context in which this strategy is applied. In certain cases, where the strategy is used to hide information that spontaneously emerges from the use of a system (for example communication patterns), the intent is to hide the information from anybody. In other cases, where information is collected, stored or processed legitimately by one party, the intent is to hide the information from any other, third, party. In this case, the strategy corresponds to ensuring confidentiality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Common design patterns are the use of encryption (locally, or on the network using SSL), the use of onion routing to hide traffic patterns or anonymous credentials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strategy #5: Inform\n",
      "Inform data subjects about the processing of their personal data in a timely and adequate manner.\n",
      "Often, data protection regulation requires that data subjects are properly informed about the fact that personal information is processed when they use a certain system (or when they enter an area with camera surveillance). The inform pattern underlines this fact. Data subjects should be informed about which information is processed, for what purpose, and by which means. This also includes information about the ways the information is protected, i.e. being open about the security of the system (the Kerckhoffs Strategy). Data subjects should also be informed about third parties with which information is shared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Possible design patterns in this category are transparency, the (these days pretty much defunct) Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) and data breach notifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strategy #6: Control\n",
      "Provide data subjects adequate control over the processing of their personal data.\n",
      "The control strategy is in fact an important counterpart to the inform strategy. Without reasonable means of controlling the use of ones personal information, there is little use in informing a data subject about the fact that personal information is collected. Data protection legislation often gives the data subject the right to view, update and even ask the deletion of personal data collected about him. This strategy underlines this fact, and design patterns in this class will give users the tools to exert their data protection rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Control goes beyond the strict implementation of data protection rights, however. It also governs the means by which users can decide whether to use a certain system, and the way they control what kind of information is processed about them. In the context of social networks, for example, the ease with which the user can update his privacy settings through the user interface determines the level of control to a large extent. So user interaction design is an important factor as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are not aware of specific design patterns that fit this strategy, although informed consent, and certain user interaction design patterns could fit the bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strategy #7: Enforce\n",
      "Commit to processing personal data in a privacy friendly way, and adequately enforce this.\n",
      "The enforce strategy ensures that the system is compatible with data protection legislation, both at the time when the system is developed, as well as when the system is in operation. By specifying a privacy policy, and setting up the appropriate governance structures to enforce that policy, proper embedding of the IT system within the organisation is established.\n",
      "\n",
      "Design patterns that implement this strategy could be certain types of access control, and systems that implement privacy rights management (a form of digital rights management involving licenses to personal data, but then applied to privacy).\n",
      "\n",
      "Strategy #8: Demonstrate\n",
      "Demonstrate you are processing personal data in a privacy friendly way.\n",
      "This strategy goes one step further than the enforce strategy in that it requires the data controller to prove that it is in control. In particular this requires the data controller to be able to show how the privacy policy is effectively implemented within the IT system. In case of complaints or problems, he should immediately be able to determine the extent of any possible privacy breaches, for example.\n",
      "\n",
      "Design patterns that implement this strategy are, for example, privacy management systems, and the use of logging and auditing.\n",
