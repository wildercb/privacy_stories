Privacy We collect consumer information, including but not limited to: Phone Number, Email, Spending and Site Visit Habits, Full name, and address. By making a purchase and inputting your information, you agree to us collecting, storing, and using your data in the following ways. 1: The restaurant may contact you regarding food items or order conditions, for example, to tell you a food item is unavailable, to adjust the fulfillment time, etc. 2: The restaurant and its employees will be able to see your basic information to make reference to your order, or to get in contact with you in case of any changes, or to provide you with order updates. Employees and owners are not allowed to contact customers for any other purposes than what is within reason to provide order updates. If you suspect abuse, please email support@blueplate.ai immediately. 3: You may be contacted by the Online Ordering Provider (Blueplate) to ask for your feedback regarding the online ordering system 4: You will be sent, by our automatic system, an order confirmation email if your order went through, and an emailed receipt by one of our payments partners. Your email may be stored by Sendgrid, a Twilio Product, but you will not be solicited offers by them, or receive marketing emails from them unless you sign up for the appropriate service. 5: You may receive an automatic feedback email from Blueplate. 6. You may receive general marketing communications from Blueplate, with an option to “opt out” or “unsubscribe” 7. Your data may be used in the aggregate to make informed decisions regarding overall consumer spending habits or site visit habits. 8. You may receive a confirmation text/pickup ready SMS text message. 9. We may use your data to market to you or people similar to you on our internal system. Your information is never revealed to the person being marketed to, to the public, or to third parties. For example, our system may determine that because of your spending habits, people like you may want to buy the same thing – we’d then recommend that person buys something because of the way you spent. We do not share your information with them. We may also market back to you based on your own spending habits. 10. We may use your data in the aggregate to make actionable insights in real time to other restaurants and their employees. For example, our system may use your spending habits to attempt to predict popular times and rush times, sharing this information with restaurant employees to prepare appropriately for when they might get busy. 11.We may use data about you to link actions across the platform and attribute them to you, for example if you use the same card or the same email address on two different platform actions, we’ll link them to your customer profile 12. We may collect data about your visit and site habits, such as what you click on, how you interact with the site, how long you visit for, and more. We may collect your IP address and other information regarding your internet connection, mostly for security purposes. Cookies and Device Storage We collect cookies, but not the kind you eat, as well as store information on your device. Everything Blueplate does related to cookies and device storage are for your convenience only, and shouldn’t affect your use of the service as a whole. We use cookies exclusively for authentication purposes. By storing cookies, we are able to securely, magically log you back in without you having to type in your username and password each and every time. By disabling cookies, you will not be able to persist your login, although the rest of the service should function fine. If you clear your cookies, you’ll lose any saved login details you may have had. We store information on your device specifically related to your visit and your site data. Most commonly, we’ll save your carts and abandoned carts so that just in case something happens, you don’t lose your order progress. If you disable local and session storage on your machine, the service will function fine, but your carts will be cleared on each visit, or if something out of the ordinary happens, such as a page crash, you’ll lose your progress. Cards and PCI As a facilitator of card transactions, we take card privacy, PCI compliance, and general security very seriously. Although our legal agreements with our processing partners (and general security concerns) prevent us from going fully into detail about what measures we take, we can say this: Card data is sent directly to our payment partners, and is never stored on our servers. Saved cards are stored managed by these partners. We follow and abide by ALL PCI regulations and standards. We accept the 4 major American Card brands: Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. We apply a 5.99% Convenience Fee to offset the restaurants cost of cards and help pay for the service. This fee is applied in compliance with convenience fee programs set by the card brands. Fulfillment Policy Orders that are recieved are prepared for the designated time provided. Please come to the pickup window and state your name. The associate may ask you to provide additional information for verification purposes. If your order is recieved but not ready, the restaurant will do their best in good faith to notify you when it will be ready. Enjoy! Occasionally, for reasons that are beyond our control, orders that are confirmed are not received. Power outages, network interruptions, severe weather, etc, may impact a restaurants ability to receive online orders.","ai.bluplate

User: Privacy Policy:
In this case, we’ll reconcile between all 3 parties (you, the restaurant, and Blueplate, the provider) will find the best solution to satisfy you. Our top priority is to ensure that your original intent (purchasing food items through our software) is fulfilled. If an order confirmation is given, that is our system telling us it did its job. In the case of an order being confirmed, our system has processed your order. In the case of an order confirmation going through, but the restaurant not receiving it, we typically look first at external sources such as power outages or network interruptions, such as internet service providers having a service outage. Our system does our best to ensure a reliable connection is made before confirming the order, but this isn’t (and can’t) always be the case. Some orders, as is with technology, may slip through the cracks and miss all filters and precautions put in place. We will reconcile with you and with the restaurant in this case to ensure everyone is satisfied. Delivery and Shipment Policy Blueplate does not offer delivery services – any order placed for delivery on the Blueplate network is fufilled by the restaurants own delivery drivers. Any and all delivery policies are to be deferred to that restaurant. Issues with and concerning delivery are typically deferred to the restaurant. Blueplate will attempt to fix any delivery errors in good faith, but as Blueplate does not offer delivery, we do not protect against any errors in this regard. In most cases, Blueplate is a pickup only service. Refund Policy In order to get a refund, please use the support and feedback center and get in contact diretly through those channels.

These annotations reflect direct interpretations of mentioned practices without inferring intentions or details not explicitly stated in the text.","Given the absence of explicit mention of many privacy-specific actions, data types, and purposes traditionally found in privacy policies, my analysis will focus on inferred behaviors based on the context provided by the text. However, it's crucial to note that making direct references to the original text and avoiding assumptions is essential. 

Though there is no explicit detail about the collection, processing, sharing, deleting of data, or data types such as personal information in a traditional sense, we can infer certain privacy-related activities based on the described functionalities and policies of Blueplate. Here are the inferred privacy stories:

1. We **process** ""Account Information"" and ""Contact Data"" (inferred data types) for the purpose of **Functionality** to ensure the successful completion of food orders through our software. This includes the processing necessary to confirm orders and to investigate the reasons behind any orders not being received by the restaurant, such as examining external factors like power outages or internet service disruptions.

2. We **share** ""Usage Data"" and possibly ""Contact Data"" (inferred data types) internally for the purpose of **Analytics** to resolve conflicts and ensure customer satisfaction when issues with order confirmation or delivery arise. This sharing is crucial for identifying the cause of the issue (e.g., power outages, network interruptions) and determining the appropriate course of action to fulfill the customer's original intent.

3. We **collect** ""Contact Data"" (inferred data type) indirectly through the operation of a support and feedback center for the purpose of **Contact**. This allows us to offer a direct channel for customers seeking refunds or needing to cancel an order, ensuring they can quickly get in touch with us to address their concerns.

4. We **collect** and **process** data related to delivery errors (the type of data can be inferred to include ""Contact Data"" and specific order details, which fall under ""Account Information"") for the purpose of **Functionality**. Though not directly offering delivery services, we engage in good faith to fix any issues arising in the process to ensure the customer's experience aligns with their expectations of our pickup service.

5. We **use** ""Account Information"" and potentially ""Usage Data"" (as it concerns the interaction with the online ordering and feedback systems) for the purpose of **Identification**. This could be necessary for authenticating requests for canceling orders or seeking refunds and for verifying feedback to maintain the integrity and reliability of these processes.

These privacy stories are generated based on the implied privacy-related activities within the given policy extract.

In this case, we’ll reconcile between all 3 parties (you, the restaurant, and Blueplate, the provider) will find the best solution to satisfy you. Our top priority is to ensure that your original intent (purchasing food items through our software) is fulfilled. If an order confirmation is given, that is our system telling us it did its job.

Some orders, as is with technology, may slip through the cracks and miss all filters and precautions put in place.

Delivery and Shipment Policy Blueplate does not offer delivery services – any order placed for delivery on the Blueplate network is fufilled by the restaurants own delivery drivers. Any and all delivery policies are to be deferred to that restaurant. Issues with and concerning delivery are typically deferred to the restaurant.

In most cases, Blueplate is a pickup only service. Refund Policy In order to get a refund, please use the support and feedback center and get in contact diretly through those channels. We will provide a partial or full refund for a missing item, wrong item, or item that does not fall under normal standards, such as presence of hair.

User: Write the privacy behaviors found within this text and those which are connected reflect a critical understanding of the text. Be mindful of avoiding assumptions or hallucinations that are not supported by the text.
System: Privacy Behaviors:",,,"The provided text mainly covers operational aspects and policy information regarding order processing, delivery, and refunds rather than explicit privacy behaviors related to the collection, processing, or sharing of personal data. However, interpreting the text concerning privacy behavior taxonomy, we can identify and infer a minimal set of behaviors related to the handling of personal information implicitly involved in the described processes:

1. **Actions: Process**
    - Subcategory: Inference
        - Description: The system processes orders, which implies it uses personal information (implicitly collected during order placement) to fulfill the service. This could be inferred from the statements around order confirmation and reconciliation processes which necessitate processing personal information to ensure order fulfillment.
        - Evidence: ""If an order confirmation is given, that is our system telling us it did its job."" This suggests the system processes information to verify the order status.
        - Connected Behavior: Functionality, to provide service as intended (fulfilling food orders).

2. **Actions: Share (Implied)**
    - Since the policy mentions reconciliation between parties (customer, restaurant, Blueplate), there's an implied sharing or at least, use of shared personal information to resolve discrepancies in orders. This is not explicitly stated but can be inferred given that reconciliation cannot occur without some degree of information sharing or use among involved parties.
        - Evidence: ""...we’ll reconcile between all 3 parties (you, the restaurant, and Blueplate...)."" Implies that information relevant to the transaction is used/shared to resolve issues.
        - Connected Behavior: This sharing is connected to the purpose of functionality and customer support.

3. **Data Types: Personal Data (Implied)**
    - The specific types of personal data are not explicitly listed in this segment. However, the mention of ""purchasing food items through our software"" and order confirmation implies that contact data, possibly including name and contact details, and transaction data (i.e., details of food items ordered) are processed by the system.
        - Connected Behavior: This processing is crucial for the functionality of the service (order processing and confirmation).

4. **Purpose: Functionality**
    - The policy revolves around ensuring the functionality of the ordering service despite potential technical interruptions. The primary purpose of processing data here seems to be to maintain and provide the expected service (online food ordering) to customers.
        - Evidence: ""Our top priority is to ensure that your original intent (purchasing food items through our software) is fulfilled.""

5. **Purpose: Support**
    - Offering solutions and rectifications for order issues indicates processing personal data for support purposes. Whether it's adjusting orders, refunds, or addressing delivery problems, each action indirectly involves handling personal data to provide these supports.
        - Evidence: ""In order to get a refund, please use the support and feedback center..."" and ""Blueplate will attempt to fix any delivery errors in good faith...""

In summary, while the text does not explicitly elaborate on privacy behaviors in the manner privacy policies often do, interpreting its operational descriptions suggests implicit processing and handling of personal data to fulfill service delivery and support. These inferences are aligned with ensuring that assumptions or interpretations remain directly connected to the information provided in the text, avoiding any unsupported extrapolations.",,
"Section 1 Size ~2000: Blueplate Open main menu Platform About Pricing Support Log in Blueplate Provisio version 1.11.0 Last updated 9/15/2023 Support Contact Information: 805.800.8050 support@blueplate.ai This terms of service goes over the terms of a relationship between the restaurant, Blueplate Holdings LLC (the provider) and you, the consumer.

Your information is never revealed to the person being marketed to, to the public, or to third parties. For example, our system may determine that because of your spending habits, people like you may want to buy the same thing – we’d then recommend that person buys something because of the way you spent. We do not share your information with them. We may also market back to you based on your own spending habits. 10. We may use your data in the aggregate to make actionable insights in real time to other restaurants and their employees.

Although our legal agreements with our processing partners (and general security concerns) prevent us from going fully into detail about what measures we take, we can say this: Card data is sent directly to our payment partners, and is never stored on our servers. Saved cards are stored managed by these partners. We follow and abide by ALL PCI regulations and standards. We accept the 4 major American Card brands: Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. We apply a 5.99% Convenience Fee to offset the restaurants cost of cards and help pay for the service. This fee is applied in compliance with convenience fee programs set by the card brands. Fulfillment Policy Orders that are recieved are prepared for the designated time provided.

Cookies and Device Storage We collect cookies, but not the kind you eat, as well as store information on your device. Everything Blueplate does related to cookies and device storage are for your convenience only, and shouldn’t affect your use of the service as a whole. We use cookies exclusively for authentication purposes. By storing cookies, we are able to securely, magically log you back in without you having to type in your username and password each and every time. By disabling cookies, you will not be able to persist your login, although the rest of the service should function fine. If you clear your cookies, you’ll lose any saved login details you may have had. We store information on your device specifically related to your visit and your site data. Most commonly, we’ll save your carts and abandoned carts so that just in case something happens, you don’t lose your order progress. If you disable local and session storage on your machine, the service will function fine, but your carts will be cleared on each visit, or if something out of the ordinary happens, such as a page crash, you’ll lose your progress. Cards and PCI As a facilitator of card transactions, we take card privacy, PCI compliance, and general security very seriously. Although our legal agreements with our processing partners (and general security concerns) prevent us from going fully into detail about what measures we take, we can say this: Card data is sent directly to our payment partners, and is never stored on our servers. Saved cards are stored managed by these partners. We follow and abide by ALL PCI regulations and standards. We accept the 4 major American Card brands: Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. We apply a 5.99% Convenience Fee to offset the restaurants cost of cards and help pay for the service. This fee is applied in compliance with convenience fee programs set by the card brands. Fulfillment Policy Orders that are recieved are prepared for the designated time provided. Please come to the pickup window and state your name. The associate may ask you to provide additional information for verification purposes. If your order is recieved but not ready, the restaurant will do their best in good faith to notify you when it will be ready. Enjoy! Occasionally, for reasons that are beyond our control, orders that are confirmed are not received. Power outages, network interruptions, severe weather, etc, may impact a restaurants ability to receive online orders.","ai.bluplate

By making a purchase and inputting your information, you agree to us collecting, storing, and using your data in the following ways. 1: The restaurant may contact you regarding food items or order conditions, for example, to tell you a food item is unavailable, to adjust the fulfillment time, etc. 2: The restaurant and its employees will be able to see your basic information to make reference to your order, or to get in contact with you in case of any changes, or to provide you with order updates. Employees and owners are not allowed to contact customers for any other purposes than what is within reason to provide order updates. If you suspect abuse, please email support@blueplate.ai immediately. 3: You may be contacted by the Online Ordering Provider (Blueplate) to ask for your feedback regarding the online ordering system 4: You will be sent, by our automatic system, an order confirmation email if your order went through, and an emailed receipt by one of our payments partners. Your email may be stored by Sendgrid, a Twilio Product, but you will not be solicited offers by them, or receive marketing emails from them unless you sign up for the appropriate service. 5: You may receive an automatic feedback email from Blueplate. 6. You may receive general marketing communications from Blueplate, with an option to “opt out” or “unsubscribe” 7. Your data may be used in the aggregate to make informed decisions regarding overall consumer spending habits or site visit habits. 8. You may receive a confirmation text/pickup ready SMS text message. 9. We may use your data to market to you or people similar to you on our internal system. Your information is never revealed to the person being marketed to, to the public, or to third parties. For example, our system may determine that because of your spending habits, people like you may want to buy the same thing – we’d then recommend that person buys something because of the way you spent. We do not share your information with them. We may also market back to you based on your own spending habits. 10. We may use your data in the aggregate to make actionable insights in real time to other restaurants and their employees. For example, our system may use your spending habits to attempt to predict popular times and rush times, sharing this information with restaurant employees to prepare appropriately for when they might get busy. 11.We may use data about you to link actions across the platform and attribute them to you, for example if you use the same card or the same email address on two different platform actions, we’ll link them to your customer profile 12.

Everything Blueplate does related to cookies and device storage are for your convenience only, and shouldn’t affect your use of the service as a whole. We use cookies exclusively for authentication purposes. By storing cookies, we are able to securely, magically log you back in without you having to type in your username and password each and every time. By disabling cookies, you will not be able to persist your login, although the rest of the service should function fine. If you clear your cookies, you’ll lose any saved login details you may have had. We store information on your device specifically related to your visit and your site data. Most commonly, we’ll save your carts and abandoned carts so that just in case something happens, you don’t lose your order progress. If you disable local and session storage on your machine, the service will function fine, but your carts will be cleared on each visit, or if something out of the ordinary happens, such as a page crash, you’ll lose your progress. Cards and PCI As a facilitator of card transactions, we take card privacy, PCI compliance, and general security very seriously. Although our legal agreements with our processing partners (and general security concerns) prevent us from going fully into detail about what measures we take, we can say this: Card data is sent directly to our payment partners, and is never stored on our servers. Saved cards are stored managed by these partners. We follow and abide by ALL PCI regulations and standards. We accept the 4 major American Card brands: Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. We apply a 5.99% Convenience Fee to offset the restaurants cost of cards and help pay for the service. This fee is applied in compliance with convenience fee programs set by the card brands. Fulfillment Policy Orders that are recieved are prepared for the designated time provided. Please come to the pickup window and state your name. The associate may ask you to provide additional information for verification purposes. If your order is recieved but not ready, the restaurant will do their best in good faith to notify you when it will be ready. Enjoy! Occasionally, for reasons that are beyond our control, orders that are confirmed are not received. Power outages, network interruptions, severe weather, etc, may impact a restaurants ability to receive online orders.

In this case, we’ll reconcile between all 3 parties (you, the restaurant, and Blueplate, the provider) will find the best solution to satisfy you. Our top priority is to ensure that your original intent (purchasing food items through our software) is fulfilled. If an order confirmation is given, that is our system telling us it did its job. In the case of an order being confirmed, our system has processed your order. In the case of an order confirmation going through, but the restaurant not receiving it, we typically look first at external sources such as power outages or network interruptions, such as internet service providers having a service outage. Our system does our best to ensure a reliable connection is made before confirming the order, but this isn’t (and can’t) always be the case. Some orders, as is with technology, may slip through the cracks and miss all filters and precautions put in place. We will reconcile with you and with the restaurant in this case to ensure everyone is satisfied. Delivery and Shipment Policy Blueplate does not offer delivery services – any order placed for delivery on the Blueplate network is fufilled by the restaurants own delivery drivers. Any and all delivery policies are to be deferred to that restaurant. Issues with and concerning delivery are typically deferred to the restaurant. Blueplate will attempt to fix any delivery errors in good faith, but as Blueplate does not offer delivery, we do not protect against any errors in this regard. In most cases, Blueplate is a pickup only service. Refund Policy In order to get a refund, please use the support and feedback center and get in contact diretly through those channels. We will provide a partial or full refund for a missing item, wrong item, or item that does not fall under normal standards, such as presence of hair. To cancel an order, please reach out as soon as possible. As ALL orders are made as soon as they are recieved, we may not be able to cancel all orders, but we will do our best in good faith to make things right.

We do not share your information with them. We may also market back to you based on your own spending habits. 10.

Blueplate Open main menu Platform About Pricing Support Log in Blueplate Provisio version 1.11.0 Last updated 9/15/2023 Support Contact Information: 805.800.8050 support@blueplate.ai This terms of service goes over the terms of a relationship between the restaurant, Blueplate Holdings LLC (the provider) and you, the consumer. Privacy We collect consumer information, including but not limited to: Phone Number, Email, Spending and Site Visit Habits, Full name, and address. By making a purchase and inputting your information, you agree to us collecting, storing, and using your data in the following ways. 1: The restaurant may contact you regarding food items or order conditions, for example, to tell you a food item is unavailable, to adjust the fulfillment time, etc. 2: The restaurant and its employees will be able to see your basic information to make reference to your order, or to get in contact with you in case of any changes, or to provide you with order updates. Employees and owners are not allowed to contact customers for any other purposes than what is within reason to provide order updates. If you suspect abuse, please email support@blueplate.ai immediately. 3: You may be contacted by the Online Ordering Provider (Blueplate) to ask for your feedback regarding the online ordering system 4: You will be sent, by our automatic system, an order confirmation email if your order went through, and an emailed receipt by one of our payments partners. Your email may be stored by Sendgrid, a Twilio Product, but you will not be solicited offers by them, or receive marketing emails from them unless you sign up for the appropriate service. 5: You may receive an automatic feedback email from Blueplate. 6. You may receive general marketing communications from Blueplate, with an option to “opt out” or “unsubscribe” 7. Your data may be used in the aggregate to make informed decisions regarding overall consumer spending habits or site visit habits. 8. You may receive a confirmation text/pickup ready SMS text message. 9. We may use your data to market to you or people similar to you on our internal system. Your information is never revealed to the person being marketed to, to the public, or to third parties. For example, our system may determine that because of your spending habits, people like you may want to buy the same thing – we’d then recommend that person buys something because of the way you spent. We do not share your information with them. We may also market back to you based on your own spending habits. 10. We may use your data in the aggregate to make actionable insights in real time to other restaurants and their employees. For example, our system may use your spending habits to attempt to predict popular times and rush times, sharing this information with restaurant employees to prepare appropriately for when they might get busy. 11.We may use data about you to link actions across the platform and attribute them to you, for example if you use the same card or the same email address on two different platform actions, we’ll link them to your customer profile 12. We may collect data about your visit and site habits, such as what you click on, how you interact with the site, how long you visit for, and more. We may collect your IP address and other information regarding your internet connection, mostly for security purposes. Cookies and Device Storage We collect cookies, but not the kind you eat, as well as store information on your device. Everything Blueplate does related to cookies and device storage are for your convenience only, and shouldn’t affect your use of the service as a whole. We use cookies exclusively for authentication purposes. By storing cookies, we are able to securely, magically log you back in without you having to type in your username and password each and every time. By disabling cookies, you will not be able to persist your login, although the rest of the service should function fine. If you clear your cookies, you’ll lose any saved login details you may have had. We store information on your device specifically related to your visit and your site data. Most commonly, we’ll save your carts and abandoned carts so that just in case something happens, you don’t lose your order progress. If you disable local and session storage on your machine, the service will function fine, but your carts will be cleared on each visit, or if something out of the ordinary happens, such as a page crash, you’ll lose your progress. Cards and PCI As a facilitator of card transactions, we take card privacy, PCI compliance, and general security very seriously. Although our legal agreements with our processing partners (and general security concerns) prevent us from going fully into detail about what measures we take, we can say this: Card data is sent directly to our payment partners, and is never stored on our servers. Saved cards are stored managed by these partners. We follow and abide by ALL PCI regulations and standards. We accept the 4 major American Card brands: Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. We apply a 5.99% Convenience Fee to offset the restaurants cost of cards and help pay for the service. This fee is applied in compliance with convenience fee programs set by the card brands. Fulfillment Policy Orders that are recieved are prepared for the designated time provided. Please come to the pickup window and state your name. The associate may ask you to provide additional information for verification purposes. If your order is recieved but not ready, the restaurant will do their best in good faith to notify you when it will be ready. Enjoy! Occasionally, for reasons that are beyond our control, orders that are confirmed are not received. Power outages, network interruptions, severe weather, etc, may impact a restaurants ability to receive online orders.

System: Privacy Behaviors:
Based on the provided taxonomy and the text excerpts given, identifying the explicit privacy behaviors in these scenarios is somewhat challenging due to the nature of the content focusing more on service functionality, refund policies, and operational details rather than typical privacy-related behaviors such as data collection, processing, or sharing. However, based on the information provided, we can infer certain behaviors related to the handling of user data, even if not directly stated:

1. **Process: Inference**
    - When reconciling between parties (user, restaurant, Blueplate) to ensure the original intent of purchasing food items through the software is fulfilled, it likely involves processing user data to identify the order, status, and resolution steps. This falls under 'Process' with a likely inference on user behavior or order details.

2. **Functionality: Provide Service**
    - The description of Blueplate's efforts to maintain a reliable connection for order confirmations, and their active role in resolving issues where the order confirmation goes through but the restaurant does not receive it, suggests a behavior aimed at enhancing the functionality of their service. This aligns with the 'Functionality' category, specifically under 'Provide Service', as it involves operational procedures meant to ensure the service works as intended for the user.

3. **Functionality: Support, Promotions**
    - The part about providing refunds for issues like missing items, wrong items, or items not meeting standards involves processing user requests and feedback for support. It demonstrates a commitment to customer service, which falls under the 'Functionality' category as 'Support'. Furthermore, attempting to resolve these issues positively could also be seen as a form of promotion for their service quality.

4. **Requirements: Compliance**
    - While not explicitly stated in the user-provided content, the addressing of refunds and the mechanism for processing these requests could imply adherence to certain legal or policy requirements regarding consumer rights. This might be categorized under 'Requirements', specifying 'Compliance' with consumer protection laws.

Although the text primarily outlines operational practices rather than the collection, processing, or sharing of personal data, the actions described implicitly involve handling user information to facilitate service functionality, support, and adherence to applicable standards or regulations. Direct mentions of privacy-specific behaviors such as consent, data types handled, or purposes for data processing beyond service delivery and support are not explicitly provided in the excerpts.

In this case, we’ll reconcile between all 3 parties (you, the restaurant, and Blueplate, the provider) will find the best solution to satisfy you. Our top priority is to ensure that your original intent (purchasing food items through our software) is fulfilled. If an order confirmation is given, that is our system telling us it did its job. In the case of an order being confirmed, our system has processed your order. In the case of an order confirmation going through, but the restaurant not receiving it, we typically look first at external sources such as power outages or network interruptions, such as internet service providers having a service outage. Our system does our best to ensure a reliable connection is made before confirming the order, but this isn’t (and can’t) always be the case. Some orders, as is with technology, may slip through the cracks and miss all filters and precautions put in place. We will reconcile with you and with the restaurant in this case to ensure everyone is satisfied. Delivery and Shipment Policy Blueplate does not offer delivery services – any order placed for delivery on the Blueplate network is fufilled by the restaurants own delivery drivers. Any and all delivery policies are to be deferred to that restaurant. Issues with and concerning delivery are typically deferred to the restaurant. Blueplate will attempt to fix any delivery errors in good faith, but as Blueplate does not offer delivery, we do not protect against any errors in this regard. In most cases, Blueplate is a pickup only service. Refund Policy In order to get a refund, please use the support and feedback center and get in contact diretly through those channels. We will provide a partial or full refund for a missing item, wrong item, or item that does not fall under normal standards, such as presence of hair. To cancel an order, please reach out as soon as possible. As ALL orders are made as soon as they are recieved, we may not be able to cancel all orders, but we will do our best in good faith to make things right.

User: Write the privacy behaviors found within this text and those which are connected reflect a critical understanding of the text. Be mindful of avoiding assumptions or hallucinations that are not supported by the text.
System: Privacy Behaviors:
Given the nature of the text and the detailed instructions, it appears there are no explicitly mentioned privacy behaviors related to collecting, sharing, or processing personal data in the traditional sense as one might expect in a privacy policy specification. Instead, the text discusses operational procedures and policies concerning service delivery, refunds, and order management. 

However, drawing from the inferred actions and their potential connections to privacy-related considerations in a hypothetical scenario, below are constructed privacy stories based on nuanced reading of the provided text:

1. **We (process) (user order details and feedback) for the purpose of (Functionality: Provide Service).**
   In this context, processing likely involves checking order status, identifying issues, and determining solutions to fulfill the service promise of ensuring customer satisfaction with their food orders. This action supports the operational functionality of the service by maintaining and enhancing user experience.

2. **We (process) (user communications and error reports) for the purpose of (Functionality: Support).**
   When users reach out for a refund or to report an issue concerning their order, this action involves reviewing the details provided by the user, identifying the problem (e.g., wrong item, missing item), and taking steps to rectify the situation. This demonstrates a commitment to supporting users in resolving their service-related issues.

3. **We (process) (requests for refunds and cancellations) for the purpose of (Requirements: Compliance).**
   Handling refunds and cancellations, especially under the guidelines for immediate action upon receipt of such requests, potentially aligns with compliance to customer service standards and possibly legal requirements concerning consumer rights. While not directly mentioned, this behavior underscores an implicit commitment to meeting expectations and obligations regarding refund policies.

It's important to note that these privacy stories are constructed based on the available information and plausible extrapolations from the operational details provided in the text. They serve to illustrate how the actions undertaken by the service provider in delivering their service, managing orders, and addressing customer support issues might indirectly relate to the processing of user information within the scope and limitations of the content provided.
User: Review the privacy behaviors identified . Ensure that each behavior accurately reflects the content of the input section of the privacy policy. 
User write out the privacy stories in the format of we (action) (data type) for the purpose of (purpose) for all related behaviors within this policy
 System: Privacy stories: ","Based on the provided taxonomy and the text excerpts given, identifying the explicit privacy behaviors in these scenarios is somewhat challenging due to the nature of the content focusing more on service functionality, refund policies, and operational details rather than typical privacy-related behaviors such as data collection, processing, or sharing. However, based on the information provided, we can infer certain behaviors related to the handling of user data, even if not directly stated:

1. **Process: Inference**
    - When reconciling between parties (user, restaurant, Blueplate) to ensure the original intent of purchasing food items through the software is fulfilled, it likely involves processing user data to identify the order, status, and resolution steps. This falls under 'Process' with a likely inference on user behavior or order details.

2. **Functionality: Provide Service**
    - The description of Blueplate's efforts to maintain a reliable connection for order confirmations, and their active role in resolving issues where the order confirmation goes through but the restaurant does not receive it, suggests a behavior aimed at enhancing the functionality of their service. This aligns with the 'Functionality' category, specifically under 'Provide Service', as it involves operational procedures meant to ensure the service works as intended for the user.

3. **Functionality: Support, Promotions**
    - The part about providing refunds for issues like missing items, wrong items, or items not meeting standards involves processing user requests and feedback for support. It demonstrates a commitment to customer service, which falls under the 'Functionality' category as 'Support'. Furthermore, attempting to resolve these issues positively could also be seen as a form of promotion for their service quality.

4. **Requirements: Compliance**
    - While not explicitly stated in the user-provided content, the addressing of refunds and the mechanism for processing these requests could imply adherence to certain legal or policy requirements regarding consumer rights. This might be categorized under 'Requirements', specifying 'Compliance' with consumer protection laws.

Although the text primarily outlines operational practices rather than the collection, processing, or sharing of personal data, the actions described implicitly involve handling user information to facilitate service functionality, support, and adherence to applicable standards or regulations. Direct mentions of privacy-specific behaviors such as consent, data types handled, or purposes for data processing beyond service delivery and support are not explicitly provided in the excerpts.","Given the nature of the text and the detailed instructions, it appears there are no explicitly mentioned privacy behaviors related to collecting, sharing, or processing personal data in the traditional sense as one might expect in a privacy policy specification. Instead, the text discusses operational procedures and policies concerning service delivery, refunds, and order management. 

However, drawing from the inferred actions and their potential connections to privacy-related considerations in a hypothetical scenario, below are constructed privacy stories based on nuanced reading of the provided text:

1. **We (process) (user order details and feedback) for the purpose of (Functionality: Provide Service).**
   In this context, processing likely involves checking order status, identifying issues, and determining solutions to fulfill the service promise of ensuring customer satisfaction with their food orders. This action supports the operational functionality of the service by maintaining and enhancing user experience.

2. **We (process) (user communications and error reports) for the purpose of (Functionality: Support).**
   When users reach out for a refund or to report an issue concerning their order, this action involves reviewing the details provided by the user, identifying the problem (e.g., wrong item, missing item), and taking steps to rectify the situation. This demonstrates a commitment to supporting users in resolving their service-related issues.

3. **We (process) (requests for refunds and cancellations) for the purpose of (Requirements: Compliance).**
   Handling refunds and cancellations, especially under the guidelines for immediate action upon receipt of such requests, potentially aligns with compliance to customer service standards and possibly legal requirements concerning consumer rights. While not directly mentioned, this behavior underscores an implicit commitment to meeting expectations and obligations regarding refund policies.

It's important to note that these privacy stories are constructed based on the available information and plausible extrapolations from the operational details provided in the text. They serve to illustrate how the actions undertaken by the service provider in delivering their service, managing orders, and addressing customer support issues might indirectly relate to the processing of user information within the scope and limitations of the content provided.","Given the directive to ensure accuracy and alignment with the provided narrative — and acknowledging that the narrative primarily focuses on service operations rather than explicit engagements with personal data from a privacy policy perspective — the revised approach will be to closely adhere to the described functions and their potential implications for privacy behaviors. As outlined, privacy-specific behaviors were not directly delineated in the provided text, but I will attempt to create hypothetical privacy stories that, while speculative, are informed by the context of service provision.

**Privacy stories:**

1. **We (process) (Order Information) for the purpose of (Functionality: Provide Service).**
   This suggests handling specifics of the food order to ensure it is prepared and relayed to the restaurant correctly, manifesting in service provision and order fulfillment functionalities.

2. **We (process) (Contact Data) for the purpose of (Functionality: Provide Support).**
   Implied in the actions of receiving complaints, feedback, or requests for refunds, there would reasonably be an interaction with user's contact information to address and resolve the presented issue efficiently, framed within the support aspect of service functionality.

3. **We (process) (Order Information and Contact Data) for the purpose of (Requirement: Compliance).**
   In handling cancellations and refunds, which requires a reactive interaction with the order details and user contact information, this behavior implicitly supports compliance with customer service expectations or, potentially, legal requirements around consumer rights and protections.

4. **We (process) (Feedback) for the purpose of (Functionality: Service Improvement).**
   This is inferred from intent to resolve any service errors or deficiencies (e.g., missing item, wrong item), indicating that customer feedback is utilized not just for immediate resolution but possibly for long-term service enhancements.

Please note, the specified privacy stories are interpretive to the degree that they propose privacy-related considerations rooted in hypothetical processing of user information for service delivery and support, assuming inherent data interactions necessary for operational success. These interpretations have been carefully crafted to align with the narrative provided and reflect a cautious approach to inferring privacy behaviors in the absence of explicit details on personal data handling practices."

Changes to this Privacy Policy 15. Contact us 16. 17. Welcome! This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, protect, and share your personal information through our services. If you reside in the European Economic Area ( EEA ) or United Kingdom, Discord Netherlands BV is the  data controller  of your personal information collected through the services (as defined in our Terms of Service ). For everyone else, Discord Inc. is the data controller. It s important that you read this entire policy, but here s a summary to get you started: We care a lot about privacy . We are committed to creating spaces where people can come together and find a place to belong. Respecting user privacy is a key part of that mission. We don t sell your personal information . Our business is based on subscriptions and paid products, not from selling your personal information to third parties. We limit what information is required . We require the information that enables us to create your account, provide and maintain our services, meet our commitments to our users, and satisfy our legal requirements. The rest is optional. We care deeply about safety . Our dedicated Trust & Safety team works hard to help keep our community safe. We also use certain information to help us identify violations of our Community Guidelines and prevent harmful content from being distributed through the services. We give you control . We give you the ability to control your privacy on Discord. Discord is your place to find community We created Discord to be a platform that brings people together over shared experiences and gives everyone a place to belong. Whether you re part of a club, gaming group, or just a handful of friends that want to spend time together, Discord makes it easy to express yourself and find community. Our  services  has the same meaning as defined in the Terms of Service . They include the Discord app, which can be accessed on mobile, web, desktop, console, or even a connected home appliance any device with a web browser and internet connection. We also have a website, blog, and support center, and we may collect your information through other means like surveys, emails, and social media. If we build another product, our services include that too. As explained in our Terms of Service , we allow users to add content to the services in a number of different ways, including via direct messages and in smaller and larger spaces. If you share content within larger spaces, that content may be accessed by many people, including people you do not know. For example, some servers are available in the Server Discovery section of the app and do not require an invite link to join. Other server owners may publish their server invite link on public websites. Anyone can access these servers, and you should be aware that server owners or admins set these permissions, and like the size of a server, the permissions may change over time. We may also use content posted in larger spaces, to help us improve and power features like Highlights Notifications , identify harmful content on the services, and enforce our Terms of Service and Community Guidelines . These things are important to us, and we believe they will make Discord even better for our users. We will always try to let you know the type of space you are in (although we don t control where invite links are shared or the permissions for that server). You can limit the extent to which your content is used for these purposes as described in the  How to control your privacy  section below. You should take all of this into account when you are using our services, and choose the spaces, features, and settings that are most appropriate for your content. We make money from paid subscriptions and the sale of digital (and sometimes physical) goods, not from selling your personal information to third parties. The information we collect We collect certain information when you use Discord. This includes information you provide to us, information we collect automatically, and information we receive from other sources. Information you provide to us Account information . When you create a Discord account, you can come up with a username and password, and provide a way of contacting you (such as an email address and/or phone number). You ll also need to provide your birthday. In some cases, you may be required to verify your account or provide additional information (like a verified phone number) to your account. You may also have the option to add your name or nicknames. Content you create . This includes any content that you upload to the service. For example, you may write messages or posts (including drafts), send voice messages, create custom emojis, create short recordings of GoLive activity, or upload and share files through the services. This also includes your profile information and the information you provide when you create servers. We generally do not store the contents of video or voice calls or channels. If we were to change that in the future (for example, to facilitate content moderation), we would disclose that to you in advance. We also don t store streaming content when you share your screen, but we do retain the thumbnail cover image for the stream for a short period of time. We may build features that help users engage with voice and video content, like create or send short recordings. Payment information . If you buy any paid services through Discord, you may need to submit a valid payment method and associated billing information, including your full name and billing address. Our payment processors, like Stripe and PayPal, receive and process your payment information. Depending on the processor, we may also receive and store certain billing information, including the last four digits of the credit card number associated with the transaction. If you sell something through Discord, you may be required to provide additional information to our payment processors, such as bank account information to facilitate payments and copies of government issued identification required to identify users in accordance with regulatory obligations. If we decide to process our own payments in the future, we would receive and process this information ourselves. Information from actions you take . We collect information about your use of Discord and your activities on the services. This includes the friends you add, the users, bots, and apps you engage with, the games you play on your device, the servers or other communities you join and participate in, your roles in servers, content moderation decisions you make, information about purchases or sales you make on or through Discord including what you purchased or sold, and other related actions. You can control whether we collect, use, and display this information as described in the  How to control your privacy  section below. Information used to enable optional features . Certain features, like contact syncing, may require that you provide additional information (or grant us access to such information) to make them work. This also includes third-party integrations you choose to enable and the data you authorize those third-party services to share with us. For example, when you link a music streaming account, we may collect information about that account such as the song you are listening to in order to display that information on your profile or as your status (if you have chosen to do so). Other information you provide directly to us . You may have the option to submit additional information as you use Discord. For example, you may choose to participate in our verified server program, which requires that you provide additional information about yourself or your company. Or, you may participate in surveys where you can provide feedback on the services, or submit information to our Discord Support teams. Information we collect automatically We also collect information automatically from you when you use Discord. This includes: Information about your device . We collect information about the device you are using to access the services. For example, this includes information like your IP address, operating system information, browser information, and information about your device settings, such as your microphone and/or camera. Information about your use of the apps or websites . For example, we collect log and event information related to how and when you use our services (such as the pages, servers, and channels you visit, the activities you engage in, or the embedded content you interact with). Other information that we collect automatically . When you take certain actions on other sites, we may receive information about you.

Changes to this Privacy Policy 15. Contact us 16. 17. Welcome! This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, protect, and share your personal information through our services. If you reside in the European Economic Area ( EEA ) or United Kingdom, Discord Netherlands BV is the  data controller  of your personal information collected through the services (as defined in our Terms of Service ). For everyone else, Discord Inc. is the data controller. It s important that you read this entire policy, but here s a summary to get you started: We care a lot about privacy . We are committed to creating spaces where people can come together and find a place to belong. Respecting user privacy is a key part of that mission. We don t sell your personal information . Our business is based on subscriptions and paid products, not from selling your personal information to third parties. We limit what information is required . We require the information that enables us to create your account, provide and maintain our services, meet our commitments to our users, and satisfy our legal requirements. The rest is optional. We care deeply about safety . Our dedicated Trust & Safety team works hard to help keep our community safe. We also use certain information to help us identify violations of our Community Guidelines and prevent harmful content from being distributed through the services. We give you control . We give you the ability to control your privacy on Discord. Discord is your place to find community We created Discord to be a platform that brings people together over shared experiences and gives everyone a place to belong. Whether you re part of a club, gaming group, or just a handful of friends that want to spend time together, Discord makes it easy to express yourself and find community. Our  services  has the same meaning as defined in the Terms of Service . They include the Discord app, which can be accessed on mobile, web, desktop, console, or even a connected home appliance any device with a web browser and internet connection. We also have a website, blog, and support center, and we may collect your information through other means like surveys, emails, and social media. If we build another product, our services include that too. As explained in our Terms of Service , we allow users to add content to the services in a number of different ways, including via direct messages and in smaller and larger spaces. If you share content within larger spaces, that content may be accessed by many people, including people you do not know. For example, some servers are available in the Server Discovery section of the app and do not require an invite link to join. Other server owners may publish their server invite link on public websites. Anyone can access these servers, and you should be aware that server owners or admins set these permissions, and like the size of a server, the permissions may change over time. We may also use content posted in larger spaces, to help us improve and power features like Highlights Notifications , identify harmful content on the services, and enforce our Terms of Service and Community Guidelines . These things are important to us, and we believe they will make Discord even better for our users. We will always try to let you know the type of space you are in (although we don t control where invite links are shared or the permissions for that server). You can limit the extent to which your content is used for these purposes as described in the  How to control your privacy  section below. You should take all of this into account when you are using our services, and choose the spaces, features, and settings that are most appropriate for your content. We make money from paid subscriptions and the sale of digital (and sometimes physical) goods, not from selling your personal information to third parties. The information we collect We collect certain information when you use Discord. This includes information you provide to us, information we collect automatically, and information we receive from other sources. Information you provide to us Account information . When you create a Discord account, you can come up with a username and password, and provide a way of contacting you (such as an email address and/or phone number).

User: Privacy Policy:
For example, when we advertise for Discord on third party platforms, if you click on the ad, we may receive information about which ad you saw and on which platform. Similarly, we may also receive certain information when you click on a referral link, such as which website you came from. We may receive information from cookies (small text files placed on your computer or device) and similar technologies. First-party cookies are placed by us (and our third-party service providers) and allow you to use the services and to help us analyze and improve your experience and the services. You can control cookies as described in the  How to control your privacy  section below. The services use the following types of cookies: Strictly Necessary Cookies : These are required for services to function and to meet our legal obligations. If you try to use tools to disable these cookies, parts of the services may not work properly. Functional Cookies : These help us provide enhanced functionality on the services like remembering language preferences. Disabling these could affect some service functionality. Performance Cookies : These allow us or our third-party analytics providers to learn how you and others use and engage with the services so we can understand and improve them. Information we receive from other sources We may receive information about you from other sources, including from other users and third parties, and combine that information with the other information we have about you. For example, if you interact with our social media account on another platform, we may receive certain information about you like your username on that platform. How we use your information We use your information for the following purposes:   To fulfill our contract with you To provide you with the services . We use your information to provide you with the Discord services. For example, when you start a video call, we process your images and audio to make that work. We similarly collect and store the messages you send and display them as you direct. We also use the information you provide to us to create and manage your account and to facilitate purchases. When you enable optional features (like connecting your Discord account to other platforms), we use information from those services to power the feature (like displaying what song you are listening to on another service within the Discord app). To meet our commitments to the Discord community . We work hard to try to make Discord a safe, positive, and inclusive place. To do so, we use your information to monitor for and take action against users and content that violate our Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and other policies. This includes responding to user reports, generating transcriptions of content as part of our investigation, detecting fraud and malware, and proactively scanning attachments and other content for illegal or harmful content. We also use certain information, which may include content reported to us, content that violates the Terms, and certain other content widely available on the service (such as public posts, usernames, avatars, banners, user profiles, server names, server icons, and server banners), to create systems and models that can be automated to more swiftly detect, categorize, and take action against prohibited content or conduct. To contact you . We use your information to contact you in connection with your account, such as to verify or secure it with two-factor authentication. We may also use your information to contact you about important product or policy changes and to send you information about products you have purchased. To provide customer service . We use your information to respond to your questions about our products and services, and to investigate bugs or other issues. For our legitimate business interests To protect our services . We use information to keep our services secure, to prevent misuse, and to enforce our Terms of Service and other policies against users who violate them. To report on our company s performance . We use your information to track the fundamental metrics of our business, to perform financial reporting, to respond to regulatory obligations, and to debug billing issues. To personalize the product . We use your information to personalize our services. This information powers our discovery surfaces (so that you see relevant communities or content first), Highlights Notifications, and similar features, and it helps us surface Discord features and promotions from us and our partners that may be of interest to you. As discussed in the  How to control your privacy  section below, you can choose to what extent we will use your personal information to personalize your Discord experience. To improve our services . We use your information to help us understand how users interact with our services, what features or products users may want, or to otherwise understand and improve our services. This includes information about how you use our services and how servers are structured. We may also use certain content that is widely available to better understand, for example, what topics servers cover and what content is most interesting within those servers. Similarly, you can limit to what extent we use your personal information for these purposes. To advertise our services on Discord and other platforms . We are proud of the product we've built. We may tell you about our paid services and other features directly in the services and through our own channels, and we spend money advertising Discord on other platforms. As part of that, we use certain information to assist in the delivery of our advertising, to measure the effectiveness of advertisements for our own products, and to improve such advertisements in the future. To contact you . We may use your information to let you know about new products or features we think you ll like. You may opt-out of receiving such marketing communications. Where local law requires, we will obtain your consent before sending such communications. To comply with our legal obligations We retain and use your information in connection with potential legal claims when necessary and for compliance, regulatory, and auditing purposes. For example, we retain information where we are required by law or if we are compelled to do so by a court order or regulatory body. Also, when you exercise any of your applicable legal rights to access, amend, or delete your personal information, we may request additional information from you for the purpose of confirming your identity. With your consent  We may also collect and use personal information with your consent, such as to send you marketing communications where legally required. You can revoke your consent at any time (mostly through our services directly), though note that you might not be able to use any service or feature that requires collection or use of that personal information. To protect someone s vital interests We may collect or share personal data if we think someone s life is in danger for example, to help resolve an urgent medical situation. How we disclose your information When you tell us to . When you add your content to the services, you are telling us to make that content available to certain people or communities. Who can access that information is determined by who can access a particular space. For servers, those permissions are set by server owners or admins. They control whether a server requires an invite link or is open and accessible to anyone. And these permissions, like the size of the server, may change over time. Similarly, if you link your Discord account with a third-party service (like a music-streaming service or gaming platform), embed content, or participate in a server that has third-party features like bots enabled, we may provide certain information to that service or to other Discord users to operate that service or feature. Additionally, if you purchase goods or services from other users on Discord, we may disclose certain information to these users in order to facilitate the delivery of the goods or services purchased or help them understand and improve their business. We may also disclose your information as you otherwise instruct us or provide us your consent to do so. With our vendors . We may provide information to vendors we hire to carry out specific work for us. This includes payment processors like Stripe and PayPal that process transactions on our behalf and cloud providers like Google that host our data and our services. We may also provide limited information to advertising platforms to help us reach people that we think will like our products and to measure the performance of our ads shown on those platforms. We do this to help bring more users to Discord and make our business successful, and provide only the information required to facilitate these services. This may include information like the fact that you installed our app or registered to use Discord. To comply with the law . We may disclose information in response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is required by law, including meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. Where allowed and feasible, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice before disclosing your information in response to such a request. Our Transparency Report has additional information about how we respond to requests from governments and law enforcement entities. In an emergency . We may disclose information if we believe in good faith that it's necessary to prevent serious harm to a person. To enforce our policies and rights . We may disclose information if needed to enforce our Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, or other policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and others. With our related companies . We may provide information to our related companies , including parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership. Sale, Acquisition, or Transfer of Assets . We may disclose information if Discord is evaluating and/or engaging in a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale, transfer, or change in ownership of Discord or any of its assets. Aggregated or de-identified information . We may disclose information that has been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we may share aggregated user statistics in order to describe our business to partners or the public. Data retention We retain personal information until we determine it is no longer needed for the processing purposes for which we collected or retain it or for legal compliance. You can learn more about data retention periods in our data retention policy . How we protect your information We take a number of steps to help protect your information. All information sent within our services is encrypted both in transit and at rest. For example, we use Transport Layer Security ( TLS ) to encrypt text and images in transit. We also enforce technical and administrative access controls to limit which of our employees and contractors have access to nonpublic personal information. You can help maintain the security of your account by configuring two-factor authentication . How to control your privacy We believe that users should be able to tailor their Discord experience to their preferences, including privacy. And while local laws may require different things, we believe that our users should have at least the same basic ability to shape their experience no matter where they are in the world. Here s how you can control how we process your information, how to delete or correct certain information, and how to request access to your information. Users in certain places may have specific rights under their local laws. You can learn more about these in the relevant sections below. Be aware of the Discord spaces you choose to participate in You can choose what communities to participate in and what information you add to our services.

This Privacy Policy explains how we  collect,   use,  store, protect, and  share your  personal information through our services. [#ns If you reside in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or United Kingdom, Discord Netherlands BV is the “data controller” of your personal information collected through the services (as defined in our
Terms of Service ). For everyone else, Discord Inc. is the data controller. It’s important that you read this entire policy, but here’s a summary to get you started: We care a lot about privacy . We are committed to creating spaces where people can come together and find a place to belong. Respecting user privacy is a key part of that mission. We don’t sell your personal information . Our business is based on subscriptions and paid products, not from selling your personal information to third parties. We limit what information is required ].   We (collect) require the information that enables us to create your account, (functionality) provide and maintain our services, meet our commitments to our users, and satisfy our  legal requirements.  [#ns The rest is optional. We care deeply about safety . Our dedicated Trust & Safety team works hard to help keep our community safe.]  We also  use certain information to help us (security) identify violations of our Community Guidelines and  (security:user security) prevent harmful content from being distributed through the services.  [#ns We give you control . We give you the ability to control your privacy on Discord. ‍ ‍ Discord is your place to find community We created Discord to be a platform that brings people together over shared experiences and gives everyone a place to belong. Whether you’re part of a club, gaming group, or just a handful of friends that want to spend time together, Discord makes it easy to express yourself and find community. Our “services” has the same meaning as defined in the
Terms of Service . They include the Discord app, which can be accessed on mobile, web, desktop, console, or even a connected home appliance—any device with a web browser and internet connection. We also have a website, blog, and support center, and]  we may  collect your information through other means like  surveys,  emails, and  social media. [#ns If we build another product, our services include that too. As explained in our
Terms of Service , we allow users to add content to the services in a number of different ways, including via direct messages and in smaller and larger spaces. If you share content within larger spaces, that content may be accessed by many people, including people you do not know. For example, some servers are available in the Server Discovery section of the app and do not require an invite link to join. Other server owners may publish their server invite link on public websites. Anyone can access these servers, and you should be aware that server owners or admins set these permissions, and like the size of a server, the permissions may change over time. We may also use content posted in larger spaces, to help us improve and power features like
Highlights Notifications , identify harmful content on the services, and enforce our
Terms of Service
and
Community Guidelines . These things are important to us, and we believe they will make Discord even better for our users. We will always try to let you know the type of space you are in (although we don’t control where invite links are shared or the permissions for that server). You can limit the extent to which your content is used for these purposes as described in the “How to control your privacy” section below. You should take all of this into account when you are using our services, and choose the spaces, features, and settings that are most appropriate for your content. We make money from paid subscriptions and the sale of digital (and sometimes physical) goods, not from selling your personal information to third parties.] ‍  The information we  collect We  collect certain information when you use Discord.

If you reside in the European Economic Area ( EEA ) or United Kingdom, Discord Netherlands BV is the  data controller  of your personal information collected through the services (as defined in our Terms of Service ). For everyone else, Discord Inc. is the data controller. It s important that you read this entire policy, but here s a summary to get you started: We care a lot about privacy . We are committed to creating spaces where people can come together and find a place to belong. Respecting user privacy is a key part of that mission. We don t sell your personal information . Our business is based on subscriptions and paid products, not from selling your personal information to third parties. We limit what information is required . We require the information that enables us to create your account, provide and maintain our services, meet our commitments to our users, and satisfy our legal requirements. The rest is optional. We care deeply about safety . Our dedicated Trust & Safety team works hard to help keep our community safe. We also use certain information to help us identify violations of our Community Guidelines and prevent harmful content from being distributed through the services. We give you control . We give you the ability to control your privacy on Discord. Discord is your place to find community We created Discord to be a platform that brings people together over shared experiences and gives everyone a place to belong. Whether you re part of a club, gaming group, or just a handful of friends that want to spend time together, Discord makes it easy to express yourself and find community. Our  services  has the same meaning as defined in the Terms of Service . They include the Discord app, which can be accessed on mobile, web, desktop, console, or even a connected home appliance any device with a web browser and internet connection. We also have a website, blog, and support center, and we may collect your information through other means like surveys, emails, and social media. If we build another product, our services include that too. As explained in our Terms of Service , we allow users to add content to the services in a number of different ways, including via direct messages and in smaller and larger spaces. If you share content within larger spaces, that content may be accessed by many people, including people you do not know. For example, some servers are available in the Server Discovery section of the app and do not require an invite link to join. Other server owners may publish their server invite link on public websites. Anyone can access these servers, and you should be aware that server owners or admins set these permissions, and like the size of a server, the permissions may change over time. We may also use content posted in larger spaces, to help us improve and power features like Highlights Notifications , identify harmful content on the services, and enforce our Terms of Service and Community Guidelines . These things are important to us, and we believe they will make Discord even better for our users. We will always try to let you know the type of space you are in (although we don t control where invite links are shared or the permissions for that server). You can limit the extent to which your content is used for these purposes as described in the  How to control your privacy  section below. You should take all of this into account when you are using our services, and choose the spaces, features, and settings that are most appropriate for your content. We make money from paid subscriptions and the sale of digital (and sometimes physical) goods, not from selling your personal information to third parties.

"Section 2 Size ~2000: For example, when we advertise for Discord on third party platforms, if you click on the ad, we may receive information about which ad you saw and on which platform. Similarly, we may also receive certain information when you click on a referral link, such as which website you came from. We may receive information from cookies (small text files placed on your computer or device) and similar technologies. First-party cookies are placed by us (and our third-party service providers) and allow you to use the services and to help us analyze and improve your experience and the services. You can control cookies as described in the  How to control your privacy  section below. The services use the following types of cookies: Strictly Necessary Cookies : These are required for services to function and to meet our legal obligations. If you try to use tools to disable these cookies, parts of the services may not work properly. Functional Cookies : These help us provide enhanced functionality on the services like remembering language preferences. Disabling these could affect some service functionality. Performance Cookies : These allow us or our third-party analytics providers to learn how you and others use and engage with the services so we can understand and improve them. Information we receive from other sources We may receive information about you from other sources, including from other users and third parties, and combine that information with the other information we have about you. For example, if you interact with our social media account on another platform, we may receive certain information about you like your username on that platform. How we use your information We use your information for the following purposes:   To fulfill our contract with you To provide you with the services . We use your information to provide you with the Discord services. For example, when you start a video call, we process your images and audio to make that work. We similarly collect and store the messages you send and display them as you direct. We also use the information you provide to us to create and manage your account and to facilitate purchases. When you enable optional features (like connecting your Discord account to other platforms), we use information from those services to power the feature (like displaying what song you are listening to on another service within the Discord app). To meet our commitments to the Discord community . We work hard to try to make Discord a safe, positive, and inclusive place. To do so, we use your information to monitor for and take action against users and content that violate our Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and other policies. This includes responding to user reports, generating transcriptions of content as part of our investigation, detecting fraud and malware, and proactively scanning attachments and other content for illegal or harmful content. We also use certain information, which may include content reported to us, content that violates the Terms, and certain other content widely available on the service (such as public posts, usernames, avatars, banners, user profiles, server names, server icons, and server banners), to create systems and models that can be automated to more swiftly detect, categorize, and take action against prohibited content or conduct. To contact you . We use your information to contact you in connection with your account, such as to verify or secure it with two-factor authentication. We may also use your information to contact you about important product or policy changes and to send you information about products you have purchased. To provide customer service . We use your information to respond to your questions about our products and services, and to investigate bugs or other issues. For our legitimate business interests To protect our services . We use information to keep our services secure, to prevent misuse, and to enforce our Terms of Service and other policies against users who violate them. To report on our company s performance . We use your information to track the fundamental metrics of our business, to perform financial reporting, to respond to regulatory obligations, and to debug billing issues. To personalize the product . We use your information to personalize our services. This information powers our discovery surfaces (so that you see relevant communities or content first), Highlights Notifications, and similar features, and it helps us surface Discord features and promotions from us and our partners that may be of interest to you. As discussed in the  How to control your privacy  section below, you can choose to what extent we will use your personal information to personalize your Discord experience. To improve our services . We use your information to help us understand how users interact with our services, what features or products users may want, or to otherwise understand and improve our services. This includes information about how you use our services and how servers are structured. We may also use certain content that is widely available to better understand, for example, what topics servers cover and what content is most interesting within those servers. Similarly, you can limit to what extent we use your personal information for these purposes. To advertise our services on Discord and other platforms . We are proud of the product we've built. We may tell you about our paid services and other features directly in the services and through our own channels, and we spend money advertising Discord on other platforms. As part of that, we use certain information to assist in the delivery of our advertising, to measure the effectiveness of advertisements for our own products, and to improve such advertisements in the future. To contact you . We may use your information to let you know about new products or features we think you ll like. You may opt-out of receiving such marketing communications. Where local law requires, we will obtain your consent before sending such communications. To comply with our legal obligations We retain and use your information in connection with potential legal claims when necessary and for compliance, regulatory, and auditing purposes. For example, we retain information where we are required by law or if we are compelled to do so by a court order or regulatory body. Also, when you exercise any of your applicable legal rights to access, amend, or delete your personal information, we may request additional information from you for the purpose of confirming your identity. With your consent  We may also collect and use personal information with your consent, such as to send you marketing communications where legally required. You can revoke your consent at any time (mostly through our services directly), though note that you might not be able to use any service or feature that requires collection or use of that personal information. To protect someone s vital interests We may collect or share personal data if we think someone s life is in danger for example, to help resolve an urgent medical situation. How we disclose your information When you tell us to . When you add your content to the services, you are telling us to make that content available to certain people or communities. Who can access that information is determined by who can access a particular space. For servers, those permissions are set by server owners or admins. They control whether a server requires an invite link or is open and accessible to anyone. And these permissions, like the size of the server, may change over time. Similarly, if you link your Discord account with a third-party service (like a music-streaming service or gaming platform), embed content, or participate in a server that has third-party features like bots enabled, we may provide certain information to that service or to other Discord users to operate that service or feature. Additionally, if you purchase goods or services from other users on Discord, we may disclose certain information to these users in order to facilitate the delivery of the goods or services purchased or help them understand and improve their business. We may also disclose your information as you otherwise instruct us or provide us your consent to do so. With our vendors . We may provide information to vendors we hire to carry out specific work for us. This includes payment processors like Stripe and PayPal that process transactions on our behalf and cloud providers like Google that host our data and our services. We may also provide limited information to advertising platforms to help us reach people that we think will like our products and to measure the performance of our ads shown on those platforms. We do this to help bring more users to Discord and make our business successful, and provide only the information required to facilitate these services. This may include information like the fact that you installed our app or registered to use Discord. To comply with the law . We may disclose information in response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is required by law, including meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. Where allowed and feasible, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice before disclosing your information in response to such a request. Our Transparency Report has additional information about how we respond to requests from governments and law enforcement entities. In an emergency . We may disclose information if we believe in good faith that it's necessary to prevent serious harm to a person. To enforce our policies and rights . We may disclose information if needed to enforce our Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, or other policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and others. With our related companies . We may provide information to our related companies , including parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership. Sale, Acquisition, or Transfer of Assets . We may disclose information if Discord is evaluating and/or engaging in a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale, transfer, or change in ownership of Discord or any of its assets. Aggregated or de-identified information . We may disclose information that has been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we may share aggregated user statistics in order to describe our business to partners or the public. Data retention We retain personal information until we determine it is no longer needed for the processing purposes for which we collected or retain it or for legal compliance. You can learn more about data retention periods in our data retention policy . How we protect your information We take a number of steps to help protect your information. All information sent within our services is encrypted both in transit and at rest. For example, we use Transport Layer Security ( TLS ) to encrypt text and images in transit. We also enforce technical and administrative access controls to limit which of our employees and contractors have access to nonpublic personal information. You can help maintain the security of your account by configuring two-factor authentication . How to control your privacy We believe that users should be able to tailor their Discord experience to their preferences, including privacy. And while local laws may require different things, we believe that our users should have at least the same basic ability to shape their experience no matter where they are in the world. Here s how you can control how we process your information, how to delete or correct certain information, and how to request access to your information. Users in certain places may have specific rights under their local laws. You can learn more about these in the relevant sections below. Be aware of the Discord spaces you choose to participate in You can choose what communities to participate in and what information you add to our services.","com.discord

When transferring data outside the EEA, we use standard contract clauses (Module 1 and Module 2), and we rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, or other legally compliant mechanisms or conditions for such data transfer. Discord and its U.S. entities/subsidiaries (Backgammon Merger Sub II, LLC, Brazos Games, LLC, Discord International, Inc, Flames Sub LLC, and Sentropy Technologies Inc.) also comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks, as well as the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. If you have questions or complaints regarding our compliance with the Data Privacy Framework principles, please reach out to us at privacy@discord.com.

For more information about the Data Privacy Framework principles and to view our certification, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce s Data Privacy Framework site . Services offered by third parties We allow third party developers to build certain features or other services and offer them within the Discord services. For example, server administrators can add  bots  created by third party developers that provide features like content moderation and interactive games. Similarly, you may have access to games or activities built by third parties within the services. These third-party services need to follow all policies that apply to them (including often our Developer Terms of Service and Developer Policy ). As part of these policies, we require developers to have a privacy policy that makes clear what they do with your information. Please review these privacy policies, as they describe what bots and apps may do with your information. We also require that certain popular bots apply for access to certain data. But because these services are operated by third parties, we don t control them or what information they collect. It s up to you whether to participate in a server that uses bots, and whether to engage with third-party services in general.

User: Privacy Policy:
For example, when we advertise for Discord on third party platforms, if you click on the ad, we may receive information about which ad you saw and on which platform. Similarly, we may also receive certain information when you click on a referral link, such as which website you came from. We may receive information from cookies (small text files placed on your computer or device) and similar technologies. First-party cookies are placed by us (and our third-party service providers) and allow you to use the services and to help us analyze and improve your experience and the services. You can control cookies as described in the  How to control your privacy  section below. The services use the following types of cookies: Strictly Necessary Cookies : These are required for services to function and to meet our legal obligations. If you try to use tools to disable these cookies, parts of the services may not work properly. Functional Cookies : These help us provide enhanced functionality on the services like remembering language preferences. Disabling these could affect some service functionality. Performance Cookies : These allow us or our third-party analytics providers to learn how you and others use and engage with the services so we can understand and improve them. Information we receive from other sources We may receive information about you from other sources, including from other users and third parties, and combine that information with the other information we have about you. For example, if you interact with our social media account on another platform, we may receive certain information about you like your username on that platform. How we use your information We use your information for the following purposes:   To fulfill our contract with you To provide you with the services . We use your information to provide you with the Discord services. For example, when you start a video call, we process your images and audio to make that work. We similarly collect and store the messages you send and display them as you direct. We also use the information you provide to us to create and manage your account and to facilitate purchases. When you enable optional features (like connecting your Discord account to other platforms), we use information from those services to power the feature (like displaying what song you are listening to on another service within the Discord app). To meet our commitments to the Discord community . We work hard to try to make Discord a safe, positive, and inclusive place. To do so, we use your information to monitor for and take action against users and content that violate our Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and other policies. This includes responding to user reports, generating transcriptions of content as part of our investigation, detecting fraud and malware, and proactively scanning attachments and other content for illegal or harmful content. We also use certain information, which may include content reported to us, content that violates the Terms, and certain other content widely available on the service (such as public posts, usernames, avatars, banners, user profiles, server names, server icons, and server banners), to create systems and models that can be automated to more swiftly detect, categorize, and take action against prohibited content or conduct. To contact you . We use your information to contact you in connection with your account, such as to verify or secure it with two-factor authentication. We may also use your information to contact you about important product or policy changes and to send you information about products you have purchased. To provide customer service . We use your information to respond to your questions about our products and services, and to investigate bugs or other issues. For our legitimate business interests To protect our services . We use information to keep our services secure, to prevent misuse, and to enforce our Terms of Service and other policies against users who violate them. To report on our company s performance . We use your information to track the fundamental metrics of our business, to perform financial reporting, to respond to regulatory obligations, and to debug billing issues. To personalize the product . We use your information to personalize our services. This information powers our discovery surfaces (so that you see relevant communities or content first), Highlights Notifications, and similar features, and it helps us surface Discord features and promotions from us and our partners that may be of interest to you. As discussed in the  How to control your privacy  section below, you can choose to what extent we will use your personal information to personalize your Discord experience. To improve our services . We use your information to help us understand how users interact with our services, what features or products users may want, or to otherwise understand and improve our services. This includes information about how you use our services and how servers are structured. We may also use certain content that is widely available to better understand, for example, what topics servers cover and what content is most interesting within those servers. Similarly, you can limit to what extent we use your personal information for these purposes. To advertise our services on Discord and other platforms . We are proud of the product we've built. We may tell you about our paid services and other features directly in the services and through our own channels, and we spend money advertising Discord on other platforms. As part of that, we use certain information to assist in the delivery of our advertising, to measure the effectiveness of advertisements for our own products, and to improve such advertisements in the future. To contact you . We may use your information to let you know about new products or features we think you ll like. You may opt-out of receiving such marketing communications. Where local law requires, we will obtain your consent before sending such communications. To comply with our legal obligations We retain and use your information in connection with potential legal claims when necessary and for compliance, regulatory, and auditing purposes. For example, we retain information where we are required by law or if we are compelled to do so by a court order or regulatory body. Also, when you exercise any of your applicable legal rights to access, amend, or delete your personal information, we may request additional information from you for the purpose of confirming your identity. With your consent  We may also collect and use personal information with your consent, such as to send you marketing communications where legally required. You can revoke your consent at any time (mostly through our services directly), though note that you might not be able to use any service or feature that requires collection or use of that personal information. To protect someone s vital interests We may collect or share personal data if we think someone s life is in danger for example, to help resolve an urgent medical situation. How we disclose your information When you tell us to . When you add your content to the services, you are telling us to make that content available to certain people or communities. Who can access that information is determined by who can access a particular space. For servers, those permissions are set by server owners or admins. They control whether a server requires an invite link or is open and accessible to anyone. And these permissions, like the size of the server, may change over time. Similarly, if you link your Discord account with a third-party service (like a music-streaming service or gaming platform), embed content, or participate in a server that has third-party features like bots enabled, we may provide certain information to that service or to other Discord users to operate that service or feature. Additionally, if you purchase goods or services from other users on Discord, we may disclose certain information to these users in order to facilitate the delivery of the goods or services purchased or help them understand and improve their business. We may also disclose your information as you otherwise instruct us or provide us your consent to do so. With our vendors . We may provide information to vendors we hire to carry out specific work for us. This includes payment processors like Stripe and PayPal that process transactions on our behalf and cloud providers like Google that host our data and our services. We may also provide limited information to advertising platforms to help us reach people that we think will like our products and to measure the performance of our ads shown on those platforms. We do this to help bring more users to Discord and make our business successful, and provide only the information required to facilitate these services. This may include information like the fact that you installed our app or registered to use Discord. To comply with the law . We may disclose information in response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is required by law, including meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. Where allowed and feasible, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice before disclosing your information in response to such a request. Our Transparency Report has additional information about how we respond to requests from governments and law enforcement entities. In an emergency . We may disclose information if we believe in good faith that it's necessary to prevent serious harm to a person. To enforce our policies and rights . We may disclose information if needed to enforce our Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, or other policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and others. With our related companies . We may provide information to our related companies , including parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership. Sale, Acquisition, or Transfer of Assets . We may disclose information if Discord is evaluating and/or engaging in a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale, transfer, or change in ownership of Discord or any of its assets.

User: Privacy Policy:
You can choose what messages to send or post, who to engage with (e.g., one or more particular users or a potentially unlimited group of users), what information to include in your profile, whether to connect any third party services to your Discord account, and more. For example, if you share content in certain spaces, such as servers listed in Server Discovery or with public invite links, your content may be accessed by anyone. Customize your personal Discord settings We offer a number of settings that allow you to tailor your experience within Discord. Some of these relate to specific features: for example, you can choose whether to display your current activity (like the game you are playing or the music you are listening to) in your status in your User Settings page (this is the gear icon next to your username). You can also access other privacy-specific settings in your User Settings. For example, you can decide which types of direct messages are scanned for explicit content, who can add you as a friend, and more. This is also where you can limit certain types of processing of your information: Limit our ability to use your data to improve our services . We offer certain settings that allow you to limit the information we collect to help us understand how users use our services, what features or products they may want, or to otherwise help us improve our business. If you turn off these settings, we will stop collecting and using certain event and log information as described in these settings. Limit our ability to personalize Discord for you . We offer certain settings that control whether and how we may personalize Discord for you, such as offering you relevant recommendations for in-app content and features. If these settings are disabled, we will stop collecting and using certain event and log information as described in these settings. You can learn more about these settings in our Help Center . Disable or delete your account You can disable or delete your account via the User Settings menu. Disabling your account stops the processing of new data, but allows you to reactivate your account without interruption to you. Deleting your account permanently deletes identifying information and anonymizes other data as described in our data retention policy . You can learn more about how to delete your account in this Help Center article and how to disable your account in this Help Center article . Manage your content and servers You may edit or delete specific pieces of information within the services: You can edit or delete any message you have sent or content you have posted if you still have access to the space where you posted it. You can edit or delete a Discord server if you have the permissions needed to do so. You can edit or delete a channel from a Discord server if you have the permissions needed to do so. Content may be retained by Discord for use as described elsewhere in this policy and in our data retention policy . Also, in limited circumstances, we may have a legal obligation to retain certain information, even if you delete the information or your account. Access your information If you want to see what information we have collected about you, you can request a copy of your data in the Privacy & Safety section of your User Settings. You should receive your data packet within 30 days. Data is delivered in common digital formats including CSV, JSON, and any other file format you used when uploading attachments to the services. You can learn more about how to access your information in our Help Center . Manage cookies To control how information is collected and used from cookies on the services, you can take one or more of the following steps. You can disable and manage some cookies through your browser settings. You will need to manage your settings for each browser you use. You can find instructions for how to manage Cookies in popular browsers such as Internet Explorer , Firefox , Chrome , Safari (iOS) , Safari (Mac) , and Opera . To disable analytics cookies, you can use the browser controls discussed above or, for certain providers, you can use their individual opt-out mechanisms, such as Google Analytics Opt-Out. Your mobile device may also include browser settings to manage the use of cookies. Your device may also have settings to control the collection and use of information in your apps. Third party groups also enable you to limit how cookies are used for advertising purposes by participating third parties. You can learn more at Network Advertising Initiative , the Digital Advertising Alliance , and for users in the EU, the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance . Depending on where you are accessing our services, you may be able to adjust your cookie preferences at any time through a cookies banner or by selecting  Cookie Settings  from the footer or menu on our website. If you disable or remove cookies, some parts of the services may not function properly. Information may be collected to remember your opt-out preferences. Questions or concerns about your privacy? You can email us at privacy@discord.com . International data transfers We are based in the United States, and we process and store information on servers located in the United States. We may also store information on servers and equipment in other countries depending on a variety of factors, including the locations of our users and service providers. These data transfers allow us to provide our services to you. By accessing or using our services or otherwise providing information to us, you understand that your information will be processed, transferred, and stored in the U.S. and other countries, where different data protection standards may apply and/or you may not have the same rights as you do under local law. When transferring data outside the EEA, we use standard contract clauses (Module 1 and Module 2), and we rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, or other legally compliant mechanisms or conditions for such data transfer. Discord and its U.S. entities/subsidiaries (Backgammon Merger Sub II, LLC, Brazos Games, LLC, Discord International, Inc, Flames Sub LLC, and Sentropy Technologies Inc.) also comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks, as well as the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. If you have questions or complaints regarding our compliance with the Data Privacy Framework principles, please reach out to us at privacy@discord.com. If we do not resolve your complaint, you may submit your complaint free of charge to JAMS . Under certain conditions specified by the Data Privacy Framework principles, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint. We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain circumstances, we may be liable for the transfer of personal data from the EU, Switzerland, or the UK to a third party outside those countries. For more information about the Data Privacy Framework principles and to view our certification, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce s Data Privacy Framework site . Services offered by third parties We allow third party developers to build certain features or other services and offer them within the Discord services. For example, server administrators can add  bots  created by third party developers that provide features like content moderation and interactive games. Similarly, you may have access to games or activities built by third parties within the services. These third-party services need to follow all policies that apply to them (including often our Developer Terms of Service and Developer Policy ). As part of these policies, we require developers to have a privacy policy that makes clear what they do with your information. Please review these privacy policies, as they describe what bots and apps may do with your information. We also require that certain popular bots apply for access to certain data. But because these services are operated by third parties, we don t control them or what information they collect. It s up to you whether to participate in a server that uses bots, and whether to engage with third-party services in general.

Information for Users in the EEA, United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Brazil Certain local laws, such as the European Union s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Brazil s Lei Geral de Prote o de Dados (LGPD), require services to provide information about the information they collect, how they use it, and the lawful basis for processing it.

This Privacy Policy explains how we  collect,   use,  store, protect, and  share your  personal information through our services. [#ns If you reside in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or United Kingdom, Discord Netherlands BV is the “data controller” of your personal information collected through the services (as defined in our
Terms of Service ). For everyone else, Discord Inc. is the data controller. It’s important that you read this entire policy, but here’s a summary to get you started: We care a lot about privacy . We are committed to creating spaces where people can come together and find a place to belong. Respecting user privacy is a key part of that mission. We don’t sell your personal information . Our business is based on subscriptions and paid products, not from selling your personal information to third parties. We limit what information is required ].   We (collect) require the information that enables us to create your account, (functionality) provide and maintain our services, meet our commitments to our users, and satisfy our  legal requirements.  [#ns The rest is optional. We care deeply about safety . Our dedicated Trust & Safety team works hard to help keep our community safe.]  We also  use certain information to help us (security) identify violations of our Community Guidelines and  (security:user security) prevent harmful content from being distributed through the services.  [#ns We give you control . We give you the ability to control your privacy on Discord. ‍ ‍ Discord is your place to find community We created Discord to be a platform that brings people together over shared experiences and gives everyone a place to belong. Whether you’re part of a club, gaming group, or just a handful of friends that want to spend time together, Discord makes it easy to express yourself and find community. Our “services” has the same meaning as defined in the
Terms of Service . They include the Discord app, which can be accessed on mobile, web, desktop, console, or even a connected home appliance—any device with a web browser and internet connection. We also have a website, blog, and support center, and]  we may  collect your information through other means like  surveys,  emails, and  social media. [#ns If we build another product, our services include that too. As explained in our
Terms of Service , we allow users to add content to the services in a number of different ways, including via direct messages and in smaller and larger spaces. If you share content within larger spaces, that content may be accessed by many people, including people you do not know. For example, some servers are available in the Server Discovery section of the app and do not require an invite link to join. Other server owners may publish their server invite link on public websites. Anyone can access these servers, and you should be aware that server owners or admins set these permissions, and like the size of a server, the permissions may change over time. We may also use content posted in larger spaces, to help us improve and power features like
Highlights Notifications , identify harmful content on the services, and enforce our
Terms of Service
and
Community Guidelines . These things are important to us, and we believe they will make Discord even better for our users.

**Privacy Concerns and Considerations**
- The privacy policy covers a broad spectrum of actions related to collecting, using, sharing, and storing user data. The specificity of purposes behind these actions suggests a structured approach to handling personal information.
- The commitment to not selling personal information aligns with a privacy-focused operation, emphasizing revenue through subscriptions and paid products instead of data monetization.
- Giving users control over their privacy, especially in terms of choosing how their data is used or displayed, is a positive aspect. However, the effectiveness of these controls and the ease with which users can manage their privacy settings are not detailed in the provided text.
- The extent of data collection, including from external sources and through automatic means, coupled with the potential for extensive integration with third-party services, highlights the importance of robust security measures and transparency about data handling practices.

The taxonomy of privacy behaviors provided in the policy underlines a structured approach to data management but also implicates the need for continuous scrutiny and transparency to ensure user trust and compliance with diverse regulatory environments.",,

For example, when we advertise for Discord on third party platforms, if you click on the ad, we may receive information about which ad you saw and on which platform. Similarly, we may also receive certain information when you click on a referral link, such as which website you came from. We may receive information from cookies (small text files placed on your computer or device) and similar technologies. First-party cookies are placed by us (and our third-party service providers) and allow you to use the services and to help us analyze and improve your experience and the services. You can control cookies as described in the  How to control your privacy  section below. The services use the following types of cookies: Strictly Necessary Cookies : These are required for services to function and to meet our legal obligations. If you try to use tools to disable these cookies, parts of the services may not work properly. Functional Cookies : These help us provide enhanced functionality on the services like remembering language preferences. Disabling these could affect some service functionality. Performance Cookies : These allow us or our third-party analytics providers to learn how you and others use and engage with the services so we can understand and improve them. Information we receive from other sources We may receive information about you from other sources, including from other users and third parties, and combine that information with the other information we have about you. For example, if you interact with our social media account on another platform, we may receive certain information about you like your username on that platform. How we use your information We use your information for the following purposes:   To fulfill our contract with you To provide you with the services . We use your information to provide you with the Discord services. For example, when you start a video call, we process your images and audio to make that work. We similarly collect and store the messages you send and display them as you direct. We also use the information you provide to us to create and manage your account and to facilitate purchases. When you enable optional features (like connecting your Discord account to other platforms), we use information from those services to power the feature (like displaying what song you are listening to on another service within the Discord app). To meet our commitments to the Discord community . We work hard to try to make Discord a safe, positive, and inclusive place. To do so, we use your information to monitor for and take action against users and content that violate our Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and other policies. This includes responding to user reports, generating transcriptions of content as part of our investigation, detecting fraud and malware, and proactively scanning attachments and other content for illegal or harmful content. We also use certain information, which may include content reported to us, content that violates the Terms, and certain other content widely available on the service (such as public posts, usernames, avatars, banners, user profiles, server names, server icons, and server banners), to create systems and models that can be automated to more swiftly detect, categorize, and take action against prohibited content or conduct. To contact you . We use your information to contact you in connection with your account, such as to verify or secure it with two-factor authentication. We may also use your information to contact you about important product or policy changes and to send you information about products you have purchased. To provide customer service . We use your information to respond to your questions about our products and services, and to investigate bugs or other issues. For our legitimate business interests To protect our services . We use information to keep our services secure, to prevent misuse, and to enforce our Terms of Service and other policies against users who violate them. To report on our company s performance . We use your information to track the fundamental metrics of our business, to perform financial reporting, to respond to regulatory obligations, and to debug billing issues. To personalize the product . We use your information to personalize our services. This information powers our discovery surfaces (so that you see relevant communities or content first), Highlights Notifications, and similar features, and it helps us surface Discord features and promotions from us and our partners that may be of interest to you. As discussed in the  How to control your privacy  section below, you can choose to what extent we will use your personal information to personalize your Discord experience. To improve our services . We use your information to help us understand how users interact with our services, what features or products users may want, or to otherwise understand and improve our services. This includes information about how you use our services and how servers are structured. We may also use certain content that is widely available to better understand, for example, what topics servers cover and what content is most interesting within those servers. Similarly, you can limit to what extent we use your personal information for these purposes. To advertise our services on Discord and other platforms . We are proud of the product we've built. We may tell you about our paid services and other features directly in the services and through our own channels, and we spend money advertising Discord on other platforms. As part of that, we use certain information to assist in the delivery of our advertising, to measure the effectiveness of advertisements for our own products, and to improve such advertisements in the future. To contact you . We may use your information to let you know about new products or features we think you ll like. You may opt-out of receiving such marketing communications. Where local law requires, we will obtain your consent before sending such communications. To comply with our legal obligations We retain and use your information in connection with potential legal claims when necessary and for compliance, regulatory, and auditing purposes. For example, we retain information where we are required by law or if we are compelled to do so by a court order or regulatory body. Also, when you exercise any of your applicable legal rights to access, amend, or delete your personal information, we may request additional information from you for the purpose of confirming your identity. With your consent  We may also collect and use personal information with your consent, such as to send you marketing communications where legally required. You can revoke your consent at any time (mostly through our services directly), though note that you might not be able to use any service or feature that requires collection or use of that personal information. To protect someone s vital interests We may collect or share personal data if we think someone s life is in danger for example, to help resolve an urgent medical situation. How we disclose your information When you tell us to . When you add your content to the services, you are telling us to make that content available to certain people or communities. Who can access that information is determined by who can access a particular space. For servers, those permissions are set by server owners or admins. They control whether a server requires an invite link or is open and accessible to anyone. And these permissions, like the size of the server, may change over time. Similarly, if you link your Discord account with a third-party service (like a music-streaming service or gaming platform), embed content, or participate in a server that has third-party features like bots enabled, we may provide certain information to that service or to other Discord users to operate that service or feature. Additionally, if you purchase goods or services from other users on Discord, we may disclose certain information to these users in order to facilitate the delivery of the goods or services purchased or help them understand and improve their business. We may also disclose your information as you otherwise instruct us or provide us your consent to do so. With our vendors . We may provide information to vendors we hire to carry out specific work for us. This includes payment processors like Stripe and PayPal that process transactions on our behalf and cloud providers like Google that host our data and our services. We may also provide limited information to advertising platforms to help us reach people that we think will like our products and to measure the performance of our ads shown on those platforms. We do this to help bring more users to Discord and make our business successful, and provide only the information required to facilitate these services. This may include information like the fact that you installed our app or registered to use Discord. To comply with the law . We may disclose information in response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is required by law, including meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. Where allowed and feasible, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice before disclosing your information in response to such a request. Our Transparency Report has additional information about how we respond to requests from governments and law enforcement entities. In an emergency . We may disclose information if we believe in good faith that it's necessary to prevent serious harm to a person. To enforce our policies and rights . We may disclose information if needed to enforce our Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, or other policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and others. With our related companies . We may provide information to our related companies , including parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership. Sale, Acquisition, or Transfer of Assets . We may disclose information if Discord is evaluating and/or engaging in a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale, transfer, or change in ownership of Discord or any of its assets. Aggregated or de-identified information . We may disclose information that has been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we may share aggregated user statistics in order to describe our business to partners or the public. Data retention We retain personal information until we determine it is no longer needed for the processing purposes for which we collected or retain it or for legal compliance. You can learn more about data retention periods in our data retention policy . How we protect your information We take a number of steps to help protect your information. All information sent within our services is encrypted both in transit and at rest. For example, we use Transport Layer Security ( TLS ) to encrypt text and images in transit. We also enforce technical and administrative access controls to limit which of our employees and contractors have access to nonpublic personal information. You can help maintain the security of your account by configuring two-factor authentication . How to control your privacy We believe that users should be able to tailor their Discord experience to their preferences, including privacy. And while local laws may require different things, we believe that our users should have at least the same basic ability to shape their experience no matter where they are in the world. Here s how you can control how we process your information, how to delete or correct certain information, and how to request access to your information. Users in certain places may have specific rights under their local laws. You can learn more about these in the relevant sections below. Be aware of the Discord spaces you choose to participate in You can choose what communities to participate in and what information you add to our services.

We use information to keep our services secure, to prevent misuse, and to enforce our Terms of Service and other policies against users who violate them. To report on our company s performance . We use your information to track the fundamental metrics of our business, to perform financial reporting, to respond to regulatory obligations, and to debug billing issues. To personalize the product . We use your information to personalize our services. This information powers our discovery surfaces (so that you see relevant communities or content first), Highlights Notifications, and similar features, and it helps us surface Discord features and promotions from us and our partners that may be of interest to you. As discussed in the  How to control your privacy  section below, you can choose to what extent we will use your personal information to personalize your Discord experience. To improve our services . We use your information to help us understand how users interact with our services, what features or products users may want, or to otherwise understand and improve our services. This includes information about how you use our services and how servers are structured. We may also use certain content that is widely available to better understand, for example, what topics servers cover and what content is most interesting within those servers. Similarly, you can limit to what extent we use your personal information for these purposes. To advertise our services on Discord and other platforms . We are proud of the product we've built. We may tell you about our paid services and other features directly in the services and through our own channels, and we spend money advertising Discord on other platforms. As part of that, we use certain information to assist in the delivery of our advertising, to measure the effectiveness of advertisements for our own products, and to improve such advertisements in the future. To contact you . We may use your information to let you know about new products or features we think you ll like. You may opt-out of receiving such marketing communications. Where local law requires, we will obtain your consent before sending such communications. To comply with our legal obligations We retain and use your information in connection with potential legal claims when necessary and for compliance, regulatory, and auditing purposes. For example, we retain information where we are required by law or if we are compelled to do so by a court order or regulatory body. Also, when you exercise any of your applicable legal rights to access, amend, or delete your personal information, we may request additional information from you for the purpose of confirming your identity. With your consent  We may also collect and use personal information with your consent, such as to send you marketing communications where legally required. You can revoke your consent at any time (mostly through our services directly), though note that you might not be able to use any service or feature that requires collection or use of that personal information. To protect someone s vital interests We may collect or share personal data if we think someone s life is in danger for example, to help resolve an urgent medical situation. How we disclose your information When you tell us to . When you add your content to the services, you are telling us to make that content available to certain people or communities. Who can access that information is determined by who can access a particular space. For servers, those permissions are set by server owners or admins. They control whether a server requires an invite link or is open and accessible to anyone. And these permissions, like the size of the server, may change over time. Similarly, if you link your Discord account with a third-party service (like a music-streaming service or gaming platform), embed content, or participate in a server that has third-party features like bots enabled, we may provide certain information to that service or to other Discord users to operate that service or feature. Additionally, if you purchase goods or services from other users on Discord, we may disclose certain information to these users in order to facilitate the delivery of the goods or services purchased or help them understand and improve their business. We may also disclose your information as you otherwise instruct us or provide us your consent to do so. With our vendors . We may provide information to vendors we hire to carry out specific work for us. This includes payment processors like Stripe and PayPal that process transactions on our behalf and cloud providers like Google that host our data and our services. We may also provide limited information to advertising platforms to help us reach people that we think will like our products and to measure the performance of our ads shown on those platforms. We do this to help bring more users to Discord and make our business successful, and provide only the information required to facilitate these services. This may include information like the fact that you installed our app or registered to use Discord. To comply with the law . We may disclose information in response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is required by law, including meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. Where allowed and feasible, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice before disclosing your information in response to such a request. Our Transparency Report has additional information about how we respond to requests from governments and law enforcement entities. In an emergency . We may disclose information if we believe in good faith that it's necessary to prevent serious harm to a person. To enforce our policies and rights . We may disclose information if needed to enforce our Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, or other policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and others. With our related companies . We may provide information to our related companies , including parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership. Sale, Acquisition, or Transfer of Assets . We may disclose information if Discord is evaluating and/or engaging in a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale, transfer, or change in ownership of Discord or any of its assets. Aggregated or de-identified information . We may disclose information that has been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we may share aggregated user statistics in order to describe our business to partners or the public. Data retention We retain personal information until we determine it is no longer needed for the processing purposes for which we collected or retain it or for legal compliance. You can learn more about data retention periods in our data retention policy . How we protect your information We take a number of steps to help protect your information. All information sent within our services is encrypted both in transit and at rest. For example, we use Transport Layer Security ( TLS ) to encrypt text and images in transit. We also enforce technical and administrative access controls to limit which of our employees and contractors have access to nonpublic personal information. You can help maintain the security of your account by configuring two-factor authentication . How to control your privacy We believe that users should be able to tailor their Discord experience to their preferences, including privacy. And while local laws may require different things, we believe that our users should have at least the same basic ability to shape their experience no matter where they are in the world. Here s how you can control how we process your information, how to delete or correct certain information, and how to request access to your information. Users in certain places may have specific rights under their local laws. You can learn more about these in the relevant sections below.

We may also store information on servers and equipment in other countries depending on a variety of factors, including the locations of our users and service providers. These data transfers allow us to provide our services to you. By accessing or using our services or otherwise providing information to us, you understand that your information will be processed, transferred, and stored in the U.S. and other countries, where different data protection standards may apply and/or you may not have the same rights as you do under local law. When transferring data outside the EEA, we use
standard contract clauses
(Module 1 and Module 2), and we rely on the European Commission's
adequacy decisions
about certain countries, as applicable, or other legally compliant mechanisms or conditions for such data transfer. Discord and its U.S. entities/subsidiaries (Backgammon Merger Sub II, LLC, Brazos Games, LLC, Discord International, Inc, Flames Sub LLC, and Sentropy Technologies Inc.) also comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks, as well as the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. If you have questions or complaints regarding our compliance with the Data Privacy Framework principles, please reach out to us at privacy@discord.com. If we do not resolve your complaint, you may submit your complaint free of charge to
JAMS . Under certain conditions specified by the Data Privacy Framework principles, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint.

In certain circumstances, we may be liable for the transfer of personal data from the EU, Switzerland, or the UK to a third party outside those countries. For more information about the Data Privacy Framework principles and to view our certification, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s
Data Privacy Framework site . ‍ Services offered by third parties We allow third party developers to build certain features or other services and offer them within the Discord services. For example, server administrators can add “bots” created by third party developers that provide features like content moderation and interactive games. Similarly, you may have access to games or activities built by third parties within the services. These third-party services need to follow all policies that apply to them (including often our
Developer Terms of Service
and
Developer Policy ). As part of these policies, we require developers to have a privacy policy that makes clear what they do with your information. Please review these privacy policies, as they describe what bots and apps may do with your information. We also require that certain popular bots apply for access to certain data. But because these services are operated by third parties, we don’t control them or what information they collect. It’s up to you whether to participate in a server that uses bots, and whether to engage with third-party services in general. ‍ Data Protection Officer You can contact Discord Netherlands BV’s Data Protection Officer at
dpo@discord.com . We’ve appointed VeraSafe as Discord’s representative in the United Kingdom for data protection matters, pursuant to Article 27 of the UK General Data Protection Regulation.

You can email us at privacy@discord.com . International data transfers We are based in the United States, and we process and store information on servers located in the United States. We may also store information on servers and equipment in other countries depending on a variety of factors, including the locations of our users and service providers. These data transfers allow us to provide our services to you. By accessing or using our services or otherwise providing information to us, you understand that your information will be processed, transferred, and stored in the U.S. and other countries, where different data protection standards may apply and/or you may not have the same rights as you do under local law. When transferring data outside the EEA, we use standard contract clauses (Module 1 and Module 2), and we rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, or other legally compliant mechanisms or conditions for such data transfer. Discord and its U.S. entities/subsidiaries (Backgammon Merger Sub II, LLC, Brazos Games, LLC, Discord International, Inc, Flames Sub LLC, and Sentropy Technologies Inc.) also comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks, as well as the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. If you have questions or complaints regarding our compliance with the Data Privacy Framework principles, please reach out to us at privacy@discord.com. If we do not resolve your complaint, you may submit your complaint free of charge to JAMS . Under certain conditions specified by the Data Privacy Framework principles, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint. We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain circumstances, we may be liable for the transfer of personal data from the EU, Switzerland, or the UK to a third party outside those countries. For more information about the Data Privacy Framework principles and to view our certification, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce s Data Privacy Framework site . Services offered by third parties We allow third party developers to build certain features or other services and offer them within the Discord services. For example, server administrators can add  bots  created by third party developers that provide features like content moderation and interactive games. Similarly, you may have access to games or activities built by third parties within the services. These third-party services need to follow all policies that apply to them (including often our Developer Terms of Service and Developer Policy ). As part of these policies, we require developers to have a privacy policy that makes clear what they do with your information. Please review these privacy policies, as they describe what bots and apps may do with your information. We also require that certain popular bots apply for access to certain data. But because these services are operated by third parties, we don t control them or what information they collect. It s up to you whether to participate in a server that uses bots, and whether to engage with third-party services in general.

We are committed to creating spaces where people can come together and find a place to belong. Respecting user privacy is a key part of that mission. We don’t sell your personal information . Our business is based on subscriptions and paid products, not from selling your personal information to third parties. We limit what information is required ].

[#ns We give you control . We give you the ability to control your privacy on Discord. ‍ ‍ Discord is your place to find community We created Discord to be a platform that brings people together over shared experiences and gives everyone a place to belong. Whether you’re part of a club, gaming group, or just a handful of friends that want to spend time together, Discord makes it easy to express yourself and find community. Our “services” has the same meaning as defined in the
Terms of Service . They include the Discord app, which can be accessed on mobile, web, desktop, console, or even a connected home appliance—any device with a web browser and internet connection. We also have a website, blog, and support center, and]  we may  collect your information through other means like  surveys,  emails, and  social media. [#ns If we build another product, our services include that too. As explained in our
Terms of Service , we allow users to add content to the services in a number of different ways, including via direct messages and in smaller and larger spaces. If you share content within larger spaces, that content may be accessed by many people, including people you do not know. For example, some servers are available in the Server Discovery section of the app and do not require an invite link to join. Other server owners may publish their server invite link on public websites. Anyone can access these servers, and you should be aware that server owners or admins set these permissions, and like the size of a server, the permissions may change over time. We may also use content posted in larger spaces, to help us improve and power features like
Highlights Notifications , identify harmful content on the services, and enforce our
Terms of Service
and
Community Guidelines . These things are important to us, and we believe they will make Discord even better for our users. We will always try to let you know the type of space you are in (although we don’t control where invite links are shared or the permissions for that server). You can limit the extent to which your content is used for these purposes as described in the “How to control your privacy” section below. You should take all of this into account when you are using our services, and choose the spaces, features, and settings that are most appropriate for your content.

You may also have the option to add your name or nicknames. Content you create . This includes any content that you upload to the service. For example, you may write messages or posts (including drafts), send voice messages, create custom emojis, create short recordings of GoLive activity, or upload and share files through the services. This also includes your profile information and the information you provide when you create servers. We generally do not store the contents of video or voice calls or channels. If we were to change that in the future (for example, to facilitate content moderation), we would disclose that to you in advance.

For example, when we advertise for Discord on third party platforms, if you click on the ad, we may receive information about which ad you saw and on which platform. Similarly, we may also receive certain information when you click on a referral link, such as which website you came from. We may receive information from cookies (small text files placed on your computer or device) and similar technologies. First-party cookies are placed by us (and our third-party service providers) and allow you to use the services and to help us analyze and improve your experience and the services. You can control cookies as described in the  How to control your privacy  section below. The services use the following types of cookies: Strictly Necessary Cookies : These are required for services to function and to meet our legal obligations. If you try to use tools to disable these cookies, parts of the services may not work properly. Functional Cookies : These help us provide enhanced functionality on the services like remembering language preferences. Disabling these could affect some service functionality. Performance Cookies : These allow us or our third-party analytics providers to learn how you and others use and engage with the services so we can understand and improve them. Information we receive from other sources We may receive information about you from other sources, including from other users and third parties, and combine that information with the other information we have about you. For example, if you interact with our social media account on another platform, we may receive certain information about you like your username on that platform. How we use your information We use your information for the following purposes:   To fulfill our contract with you To provide you with the services . We use your information to provide you with the Discord services. For example, when you start a video call, we process your images and audio to make that work. We similarly collect and store the messages you send and display them as you direct. We also use the information you provide to us to create and manage your account and to facilitate purchases. When you enable optional features (like connecting your Discord account to other platforms), we use information from those services to power the feature (like displaying what song you are listening to on another service within the Discord app). To meet our commitments to the Discord community . We work hard to try to make Discord a safe, positive, and inclusive place. To do so, we use your information to monitor for and take action against users and content that violate our Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and other policies. This includes responding to user reports, generating transcriptions of content as part of our investigation, detecting fraud and malware, and proactively scanning attachments and other content for illegal or harmful content. We also use certain information, which may include content reported to us, content that violates the Terms, and certain other content widely available on the service (such as public posts, usernames, avatars, banners, user profiles, server names, server icons, and server banners), to create systems and models that can be automated to more swiftly detect, categorize, and take action against prohibited content or conduct. To contact you . We use your information to contact you in connection with your account, such as to verify or secure it with two-factor authentication. We may also use your information to contact you about important product or policy changes and to send you information about products you have purchased. To provide customer service . We use your information to respond to your questions about our products and services, and to investigate bugs or other issues. For our legitimate business interests To protect our services . We use information to keep our services secure, to prevent misuse, and to enforce our Terms of Service and other policies against users who violate them. To report on our company s performance . We use your information to track the fundamental metrics of our business, to perform financial reporting, to respond to regulatory obligations, and to debug billing issues. To personalize the product . We use your information to personalize our services. This information powers our discovery surfaces (so that you see relevant communities or content first), Highlights Notifications, and similar features, and it helps us surface Discord features and promotions from us and our partners that may be of interest to you. As discussed in the  How to control your privacy  section below, you can choose to what extent we will use your personal information to personalize your Discord experience. To improve our services . We use your information to help us understand how users interact with our services, what features or products users may want, or to otherwise understand and improve our services. This includes information about how you use our services and how servers are structured. We may also use certain content that is widely available to better understand, for example, what topics servers cover and what content is most interesting within those servers. Similarly, you can limit to what extent we use your personal information for these purposes. To advertise our services on Discord and other platforms . We are proud of the product we've built. We may tell you about our paid services and other features directly in the services and through our own channels, and we spend money advertising Discord on other platforms. As part of that, we use certain information to assist in the delivery of our advertising, to measure the effectiveness of advertisements for our own products, and to improve such advertisements in the future. To contact you . We may use your information to let you know about new products or features we think you ll like. You may opt-out of receiving such marketing communications. Where local law requires, we will obtain your consent before sending such communications. To comply with our legal obligations We retain and use your information in connection with potential legal claims when necessary and for compliance, regulatory, and auditing purposes. For example, we retain information where we are required by law or if we are compelled to do so by a court order or regulatory body. Also, when you exercise any of your applicable legal rights to access, amend, or delete your personal information, we may request additional information from you for the purpose of confirming your identity. With your consent  We may also collect and use personal information with your consent, such as to send you marketing communications where legally required. You can revoke your consent at any time (mostly through our services directly), though note that you might not be able to use any service or feature that requires collection or use of that personal information. To protect someone s vital interests We may collect or share personal data if we think someone s life is in danger for example, to help resolve an urgent medical situation. How we disclose your information When you tell us to . When you add your content to the services, you are telling us to make that content available to certain people or communities. Who can access that information is determined by who can access a particular space. For servers, those permissions are set by server owners or admins. They control whether a server requires an invite link or is open and accessible to anyone. And these permissions, like the size of the server, may change over time. Similarly, if you link your Discord account with a third-party service (like a music-streaming service or gaming platform), embed content, or participate in a server that has third-party features like bots enabled, we may provide certain information to that service or to other Discord users to operate that service or feature. Additionally, if you purchase goods or services from other users on Discord, we may disclose certain information to these users in order to facilitate the delivery of the goods or services purchased or help them understand and improve their business. We may also disclose your information as you otherwise instruct us or provide us your consent to do so. With our vendors . We may provide information to vendors we hire to carry out specific work for us. This includes payment processors like Stripe and PayPal that process transactions on our behalf and cloud providers like Google that host our data and our services. We may also provide limited information to advertising platforms to help us reach people that we think will like our products and to measure the performance of our ads shown on those platforms. We do this to help bring more users to Discord and make our business successful, and provide only the information required to facilitate these services. This may include information like the fact that you installed our app or registered to use Discord. To comply with the law . We may disclose information in response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is required by law, including meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. Where allowed and feasible, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice before disclosing your information in response to such a request. Our Transparency Report has additional information about how we respond to requests from governments and law enforcement entities. In an emergency . We may disclose information if we believe in good faith that it's necessary to prevent serious harm to a person. To enforce our policies and rights . We may disclose information if needed to enforce our Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, or other policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and others. With our related companies . We may provide information to our related companies , including parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership. Sale, Acquisition, or Transfer of Assets . We may disclose information if Discord is evaluating and/or engaging in a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale, transfer, or change in ownership of Discord or any of its assets. Aggregated or de-identified information . We may disclose information that has been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we may share aggregated user statistics in order to describe our business to partners or the public. Data retention We retain personal information until we determine it is no longer needed for the processing purposes for which we collected or retain it or for legal compliance. You can learn more about data retention periods in our data retention policy . How we protect your information We take a number of steps to help protect your information. All information sent within our services is encrypted both in transit and at rest. For example, we use Transport Layer Security ( TLS ) to encrypt text and images in transit. We also enforce technical and administrative access controls to limit which of our employees and contractors have access to nonpublic personal information. You can help maintain the security of your account by configuring two-factor authentication . How to control your privacy We believe that users should be able to tailor their Discord experience to their preferences, including privacy. And while local laws may require different things, we believe that our users should have at least the same basic ability to shape their experience no matter where they are in the world. Here s how you can control how we process your information, how to delete or correct certain information, and how to request access to your information. Users in certain places may have specific rights under their local laws. You can learn more about these in the relevant sections below. Be aware of the Discord spaces you choose to participate in You can choose what communities to participate in and what information you add to our services.

For example, when we advertise for Discord on third party platforms, if you click on the ad, we may receive information about which ad you saw and on which platform. Similarly, we may also receive certain information when you click on a referral link, such as which website you came from. We may receive information from cookies (small text files placed on your computer or device) and similar technologies. First-party cookies are placed by us (and our third-party service providers) and allow you to use the services and to help us analyze and improve your experience and the services. You can control cookies as described in the  How to control your privacy  section below. The services use the following types of cookies: Strictly Necessary Cookies : These are required for services to function and to meet our legal obligations. If you try to use tools to disable these cookies, parts of the services may not work properly. Functional Cookies : These help us provide enhanced functionality on the services like remembering language preferences. Disabling these could affect some service functionality. Performance Cookies : These allow us or our third-party analytics providers to learn how you and others use and engage with the services so we can understand and improve them. Information we receive from other sources We may receive information about you from other sources, including from other users and third parties, and combine that information with the other information we have about you. For example, if you interact with our social media account on another platform, we may receive certain information about you like your username on that platform. How we use your information We use your information for the following purposes:   To fulfill our contract with you To provide you with the services . We use your information to provide you with the Discord services. For example, when you start a video call, we process your images and audio to make that work. We similarly collect and store the messages you send and display them as you direct. We also use the information you provide to us to create and manage your account and to facilitate purchases. When you enable optional features (like connecting your Discord account to other platforms), we use information from those services to power the feature (like displaying what song you are listening to on another service within the Discord app). To meet our commitments to the Discord community . We work hard to try to make Discord a safe, positive, and inclusive place. To do so, we use your information to monitor for and take action against users and content that violate our Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and other policies. This includes responding to user reports, generating transcriptions of content as part of our investigation, detecting fraud and malware, and proactively scanning attachments and other content for illegal or harmful content. We also use certain information, which may include content reported to us, content that violates the Terms, and certain other content widely available on the service (such as public posts, usernames, avatars, banners, user profiles, server names, server icons, and server banners), to create systems and models that can be automated to more swiftly detect, categorize, and take action against prohibited content or conduct. To contact you . We use your information to contact you in connection with your account, such as to verify or secure it with two-factor authentication. We may also use your information to contact you about important product or policy changes and to send you information about products you have purchased. To provide customer service . We use your information to respond to your questions about our products and services, and to investigate bugs or other issues. For our legitimate business interests To protect our services . We use information to keep our services secure, to prevent misuse, and to enforce our Terms of Service and other policies against users who violate them. To report on our company s performance . We use your information to track the fundamental metrics of our business, to perform financial reporting, to respond to regulatory obligations, and to debug billing issues. To personalize the product . We use your information to personalize our services. This information powers our discovery surfaces (so that you see relevant communities or content first), Highlights Notifications, and similar features, and it helps us surface Discord features and promotions from us and our partners that may be of interest to you. As discussed in the  How to control your privacy  section below, you can choose to what extent we will use your personal information to personalize your Discord experience. To improve our services . We use your information to help us understand how users interact with our services, what features or products users may want, or to otherwise understand and improve our services. This includes information about how you use our services and how servers are structured. We may also use certain content that is widely available to better understand, for example, what topics servers cover and what content is most interesting within those servers. Similarly, you can limit to what extent we use your personal information for these purposes. To advertise our services on Discord and other platforms . We are proud of the product we've built. We may tell you about our paid services and other features directly in the services and through our own channels, and we spend money advertising Discord on other platforms. As part of that, we use certain information to assist in the delivery of our advertising, to measure the effectiveness of advertisements for our own products, and to improve such advertisements in the future. To contact you . We may use your information to let you know about new products or features we think you ll like. You may opt-out of receiving such marketing communications. Where local law requires, we will obtain your consent before sending such communications. To comply with our legal obligations We retain and use your information in connection with potential legal claims when necessary and for compliance, regulatory, and auditing purposes. For example, we retain information where we are required by law or if we are compelled to do so by a court order or regulatory body. Also, when you exercise any of your applicable legal rights to access, amend, or delete your personal information, we may request additional information from you for the purpose of confirming your identity. With your consent  We may also collect and use personal information with your consent, such as to send you marketing communications where legally required. You can revoke your consent at any time (mostly through our services directly), though note that you might not be able to use any service or feature that requires collection or use of that personal information. To protect someone s vital interests We may collect or share personal data if we think someone s life is in danger for example, to help resolve an urgent medical situation. How we disclose your information When you tell us to . When you add your content to the services, you are telling us to make that content available to certain people or communities. Who can access that information is determined by who can access a particular space. For servers, those permissions are set by server owners or admins. They control whether a server requires an invite link or is open and accessible to anyone. And these permissions, like the size of the server, may change over time. Similarly, if you link your Discord account with a third-party service (like a music-streaming service or gaming platform), embed content, or participate in a server that has third-party features like bots enabled, we may provide certain information to that service or to other Discord users to operate that service or feature. Additionally, if you purchase goods or services from other users on Discord, we may disclose certain information to these users in order to facilitate the delivery of the goods or services purchased or help them understand and improve their business. We may also disclose your information as you otherwise instruct us or provide us your consent to do so. With our vendors . We may provide information to vendors we hire to carry out specific work for us. This includes payment processors like Stripe and PayPal that process transactions on our behalf and cloud providers like Google that host our data and our services. We may also provide limited information to advertising platforms to help us reach people that we think will like our products and to measure the performance of our ads shown on those platforms. We do this to help bring more users to Discord and make our business successful, and provide only the information required to facilitate these services. This may include information like the fact that you installed our app or registered to use Discord. To comply with the law . We may disclose information in response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is required by law, including meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. Where allowed and feasible, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice before disclosing your information in response to such a request. Our Transparency Report has additional information about how we respond to requests from governments and law enforcement entities. In an emergency . We may disclose information if we believe in good faith that it's necessary to prevent serious harm to a person. To enforce our policies and rights . We may disclose information if needed to enforce our Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, or other policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and others. With our related companies . We may provide information to our related companies , including parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership. Sale, Acquisition, or Transfer of Assets . We may disclose information if Discord is evaluating and/or engaging in a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale, transfer, or change in ownership of Discord or any of its assets. Aggregated or de-identified information . We may disclose information that has been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we may share aggregated user statistics in order to describe our business to partners or the public. Data retention We retain personal information until we determine it is no longer needed for the processing purposes for which we collected or retain it or for legal compliance. You can learn more about data retention periods in our data retention policy . How we protect your information We take a number of steps to help protect your information. All information sent within our services is encrypted both in transit and at rest. For example, we use Transport Layer Security ( TLS ) to encrypt text and images in transit. We also enforce technical and administrative access controls to limit which of our employees and contractors have access to nonpublic personal information. You can help maintain the security of your account by configuring two-factor authentication . How to control your privacy We believe that users should be able to tailor their Discord experience to their preferences, including privacy. And while local laws may require different things, we believe that our users should have at least the same basic ability to shape their experience no matter where they are in the world. Here s how you can control how we process your information, how to delete or correct certain information, and how to request access to your information. Users in certain places may have specific rights under their local laws. You can learn more about these in the relevant sections below. Be aware of the Discord spaces you choose to participate in You can choose what communities to participate in and what information you add to our services.

We may receive information from cookies (small text files placed on your computer or device) and similar technologies. First-party cookies are placed by us (and our third-party service providers) and allow you to use the services and to help us analyze and improve your experience and the services. You can control cookies as described in the  How to control your privacy  section below.

Performance Cookies : These allow us or our third-party analytics providers to learn how you and others use and engage with the services so we can understand and improve them. Information we receive from other sources We may receive information about you from other sources, including from other users and third parties, and combine that information with the other information we have about you.

When you enable optional features (like connecting your Discord account to other platforms), we use information from those services to power the feature (like displaying what song you are listening to on another service within the Discord app). To meet our commitments to the Discord community . We work hard to try to make Discord a safe, positive, and inclusive place. To do so, we use your information to monitor for and take action against users and content that violate our Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and other policies. This includes responding to user reports, generating transcriptions of content as part of our investigation, detecting fraud and malware, and proactively scanning attachments and other content for illegal or harmful content. We also use certain information, which may include content reported to us, content that violates the Terms, and certain other content widely available on the service (such as public posts, usernames, avatars, banners, user profiles, server names, server icons, and server banners), to create systems and models that can be automated to more swiftly detect, categorize, and take action against prohibited content or conduct. To contact you . We use your information to contact you in connection with your account, such as to verify or secure it with two-factor authentication. We may also use your information to contact you about important product or policy changes and to send you information about products you have purchased. To provide customer service .

To personalize the product . We use your information to personalize our services.

As discussed in the  How to control your privacy  section below, you can choose to what extent we will use your personal information to personalize your Discord experience. To improve our services . We use your information to help us understand how users interact with our services, what features or products users may want, or to otherwise understand and improve our services. This includes information about how you use our services and how servers are structured.

Similarly, you can limit to what extent we use your personal information for these purposes. To advertise our services on Discord and other platforms . We are proud of the product we've built. We may tell you about our paid services and other features directly in the services and through our own channels, and we spend money advertising Discord on other platforms.

How we disclose your information When you tell us to . When you add your content to the services, you are telling us to make that content available to certain people or communities. Who can access that information is determined by who can access a particular space. For servers, those permissions are set by server owners or admins.

Similarly, if you link your Discord account with a third-party service (like a music-streaming service or gaming platform), embed content, or participate in a server that has third-party features like bots enabled, we may provide certain information to that service or to other Discord users to operate that service or feature. Additionally, if you purchase goods or services from other users on Discord, we may disclose certain information to these users in order to facilitate the delivery of the goods or services purchased or help them understand and improve their business.

This may include information like the fact that you installed our app or registered to use Discord. To comply with the law .

Aggregated or de-identified information . We may disclose information that has been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we may share aggregated user statistics in order to describe our business to partners or the public. Data retention We retain personal information until we determine it is no longer needed for the processing purposes for which we collected or retain it or for legal compliance. You can learn more about data retention periods in our data retention policy . How we protect your information We take a number of steps to help protect your information. All information sent within our services is encrypted both in transit and at rest. For example, we use Transport Layer Security ( TLS ) to encrypt text and images in transit.

You can help maintain the security of your account by configuring two-factor authentication . How to control your privacy We believe that users should be able to tailor their Discord experience to their preferences, including privacy. And while local laws may require different things, we believe that our users should have at least the same basic ability to shape their experience no matter where they are in the world.

We may also store information on servers and equipment in other countries depending on a variety of factors, including the locations of our users and service providers. These data transfers allow us to provide our services to you. By accessing or using our services or otherwise providing information to us, you understand that your information will be processed, transferred, and stored in the U.S. and other countries, where different data protection standards may apply and/or you may not have the same rights as you do under local law. When transferring data outside the EEA, we use
standard contract clauses
(Module 1 and Module 2), and we rely on the European Commission's
adequacy decisions
about certain countries, as applicable, or other legally compliant mechanisms or conditions for such data transfer. Discord and its U.S. entities/subsidiaries (Backgammon Merger Sub II, LLC, Brazos Games, LLC, Discord International, Inc, Flames Sub LLC, and Sentropy Technologies Inc.) also comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks, as well as the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. If you have questions or complaints regarding our compliance with the Data Privacy Framework principles, please reach out to us at privacy@discord.com.

In certain circumstances, we may be liable for the transfer of personal data from the EU, Switzerland, or the UK to a third party outside those countries. For more information about the Data Privacy Framework principles and to view our certification, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s
Data Privacy Framework site . ‍ Services offered by third parties We allow third party developers to build certain features or other services and offer them within the Discord services. For example, server administrators can add “bots” created by third party developers that provide features like content moderation and interactive games. Similarly, you may have access to games or activities built by third parties within the services. These third-party services need to follow all policies that apply to them (including often our
Developer Terms of Service
and
Developer Policy ). As part of these policies, we require developers to have a privacy policy that makes clear what they do with your information. Please review these privacy policies, as they describe what bots and apps may do with your information. We also require that certain popular bots apply for access to certain data. But because these services are operated by third parties, we don’t control them or what information they collect. It’s up to you whether to participate in a server that uses bots, and whether to engage with third-party services in general. ‍ Data Protection Officer You can contact Discord Netherlands BV’s Data Protection Officer at
dpo@discord.com . We’ve appointed VeraSafe as Discord’s representative in the United Kingdom for data protection matters, pursuant to Article 27 of the UK General Data Protection Regulation. See the section “Contact Us” below. You can contact VeraSafe only on matters related to the processing of personal data. ‍ Information for Users in the EEA, United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Brazil Certain local laws, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Brazil’s Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD), require services to provide information about the information they collect, how they use it, and the lawful basis for processing it. We’ve described most of that already in the earlier portions of this Policy. ‍Exercising your rights:

We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain circumstances, we may be liable for the transfer of personal data from the EU, Switzerland, or the UK to a third party outside those countries. For more information about the Data Privacy Framework principles and to view our certification, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s
Data Privacy Framework site . ‍ Services offered by third parties We allow third party developers to build certain features or other services and offer them within the Discord services. For example, server administrators can add “bots” created by third party developers that provide features like content moderation and interactive games. Similarly, you may have access to games or activities built by third parties within the services. These third-party services need to follow all policies that apply to them (including often our
Developer Terms of Service
and
Developer Policy ). As part of these policies, we require developers to have a privacy policy that makes clear what they do with your information. Please review these privacy policies, as they describe what bots and apps may do with your information. We also require that certain popular bots apply for access to certain data. But because these services are operated by third parties, we don’t control them or what information they collect. It’s up to you whether to participate in a server that uses bots, and whether to engage with third-party services in general. ‍ Data Protection Officer You can contact Discord Netherlands BV’s Data Protection Officer at

These data transfers allow us to provide our services to you. By accessing or using our services or otherwise providing information to us, you understand that your information will be processed, transferred, and stored in the U.S. and other countries, where different data protection standards may apply and/or you may not have the same rights as you do under local law. When transferring data outside the EEA, we use standard contract clauses (Module 1 and Module 2), and we rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, or other legally compliant mechanisms or conditions for such data transfer. Discord and its U.S. entities/subsidiaries (Backgammon Merger Sub II, LLC, Brazos Games, LLC, Discord International, Inc, Flames Sub LLC, and Sentropy Technologies Inc.) also comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks, as well as the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework.

Similarly, you may have access to games or activities built by third parties within the services. These third-party services need to follow all policies that apply to them (including often our Developer Terms of Service and Developer Policy ). As part of these policies, we require developers to have a privacy policy that makes clear what they do with your information. Please review these privacy policies, as they describe what bots and apps may do with your information. We also require that certain popular bots apply for access to certain data. But because these services are operated by third parties, we don t control them or what information they collect.
